# Templates

Templates are the blueprints Claude reads before generating a digest. They define what sections to include, what data to gather, what analysis to perform, and how to structure the final output. Without a template, Claude would have to improvise the shape of every digest from scratch. With one, it follows a deliberate architecture that has been refined to produce consistently useful, well-structured reports.

Each template is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter and annotated section blocks. The frontmatter declares the template's name, cadence, description, and the data sources it draws from. The body contains section headings followed by `<!-- source: -->` HTML comments that tell Claude which MCP tools to consult for that section. These annotations are not executable directives -- they are instructions in natural language, read and interpreted by the generating agent. A section annotated with `<!-- source: ledger.governance, koi.governance -->` tells Claude to query both the Ledger MCP's governance tools and the KOI knowledge base for governance-related content. This keeps the data-gathering logic visible and editable without touching any code.

The template directory is organized by cadence. The [daily/](daily/) subdirectory holds templates for daily digests, the foundational rhythm of the system. The [weekly/](weekly/), [monthly/](monthly/), and [yearly/](yearly/) subdirectories will hold templates for their respective cadences as they come online in Phase 2. Each cadence can have multiple named templates -- for example, a "default" template that covers all sections and a "minimal" template that covers only governance and ecocredits. The active template for each cadence is configured in [settings.json](../settings.json) under `defaults.template`, and any command can override this with the `--template` flag.

To create a custom template, add a new markdown file to the appropriate cadence directory. Give it YAML frontmatter with `name`, `cadence`, `description`, and `sources` fields. Then write your sections with `<!-- source: -->` annotations telling Claude where to find the data. The template does not need to cover every possible data source -- it defines the shape of the digest you want, and Claude fills that shape with what it finds. Keep templates opinionated. A good template reflects a specific perspective on what matters, not an exhaustive inventory of everything that could be measured.
