# Weekly Templates

Weekly templates are a Phase 2 deliverable. This directory will hold the blueprints for weekly digests once the temporal hierarchy is fully implemented.

The weekly cadence sits at a critical inflection point in the hierarchy: daily to weekly to monthly to yearly. Daily digests capture everything. Yearly digests tell a story. The weekly digest is where raw signal first begins to crystallize into pattern. Its job is not to repeat what happened each day, but to notice what happened across days -- the proposal that gained momentum Tuesday through Thursday, the ecocredit batch that completed a trend started last week, the forum discussion that shifted from curiosity to consensus.

Weekly templates will instruct Claude to read all daily digests since the previous weekly rollup, identify recurring themes and developments, and synthesize them into a mid-range view of the ecosystem. They will also direct fresh queries to the KOI and Ledger MCPs, because some things become visible only when you ask the question at a different temporal scale. A daily digest might note a single sell order; a weekly digest can observe that marketplace activity doubled.

The weekly cadence is scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday -- frequent enough to stay current, sparse enough to allow patterns to emerge between issues. When this directory contains a `default.md` template, the `/weekly` command will use it to produce rollups that bridge the gap between daily observation and monthly reflection.
