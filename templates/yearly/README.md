# Yearly Templates

Yearly templates are a Phase 2 deliverable. This directory will hold the blueprints for yearly digests, the most reflective and integrative cadence in the system.

A year is long enough for transformation. Projects that began as proposals become operational. Governance frameworks that were contentious become settled. New credit classes mature from experimental to established. The people and partnerships that define the ecosystem shift, grow, and sometimes dissolve. Yearly digests exist to capture these arcs -- not the daily noise, not the weekly patterns, not even the monthly trends, but the fundamental changes in what the Regen ecosystem is and where it is going.

Yearly templates will instruct Claude to synthesize monthly digests into a long-form narrative that identifies the year's defining moments, turning points, and structural transformations. They will ask questions that only make sense at this scale: What was built this year that did not exist before? What was learned? What failed, and what was learned from the failure? Where is the ecosystem heading, and does it know?

The yearly cadence is aligned with the calendar's natural turning points -- solstices, equinoxes, and New Year. These are not arbitrary dates. They carry cultural weight, they mark seasonal transitions, and they invite the kind of reflective, integrative thinking that yearly digests are meant to embody. This is memory at its deepest register: the scale at which the story of regeneration becomes visible.
