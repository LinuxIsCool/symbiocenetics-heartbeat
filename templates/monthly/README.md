# Monthly Templates

Monthly templates are a Phase 2 deliverable. This directory will hold the blueprints for monthly digests once the temporal rollup system is operational.

At the monthly scale, individual events fade into the background and structural shifts come into focus. A governance proposal that dominated daily digests for two weeks becomes a single line in the monthly summary -- what matters now is whether it passed, what it changed, and what it signals about the direction of the network. Ecocredit projects that registered in week one and issued their first batch in week three become a complete arc. Partnership discussions that threaded through multiple weekly digests resolve into outcomes or dissolve into silence. The monthly cadence is where the ecosystem's structural metabolism becomes visible.

Monthly templates will guide Claude in distilling weekly digests into trend analysis and narrative arcs. They will specify how to aggregate metrics across weeks, how to identify what accelerated or decelerated, what emerged and what faded, and how to frame the month's activity within the longer trajectory of the ecosystem. Fresh MCP queries will supplement the rollup data, catching anything the weekly digests may have missed or that only becomes significant in retrospect.

The monthly cadence is scheduled for the 1st and 15th of each month -- a rhythm that divides the month into two natural halves and aligns well with governance cycles and project milestones.
