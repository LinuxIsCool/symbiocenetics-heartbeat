# Regen Heartbeat

A living pulse check on the [[docs/explanations/regen-ecosystem|Regen ecosystem]]. This site publishes automated digests that synthesize data from the Regen blockchain, the KOI knowledge commons, and the broader regenerative web into structured reports at daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly cadences.

## Browse

- **[[digests/README|Digest Archive]]** — The temporal record, organized by date
- **[[docs/README|Documentation]]** — Tutorials, guides, and reference material for the MCP tools that power this system

## What Powers This

Every digest draws from three data sources:

**[[docs/reference/koi-mcp-tools|KOI MCP]]** searches across 48,000+ documents from GitHub, Discourse, Notion, Telegram, Discord, and more — the full breadth of Regen's knowledge commons.

**[[docs/reference/ledger-mcp-tools|Ledger MCP]]** queries the Regen blockchain directly for governance proposals, ecocredit activity, marketplace orders, token supply, and community pool balances.

**Web Search** adds context from the broader regenerative, climate finance, and crypto ecosystem.

## Characters

Digests can be voiced through twelve distinct characters, each bringing a different perspective — from the Narrator's storytelling craft to the Governor's strategic eye to the Voice of Nature's ecological wisdom.

This repository also serves as an educational template for working with Claude Code. Explore the [[docs/README|Documentation]] to understand how skills, output styles, MCPs, and templates work together. Start with the [[docs/tutorials/README|Tutorials]] if you are new, or dive into the [[docs/explanations/why-these-mcps|architectural explanations]] if you want to understand the design decisions behind the system.
