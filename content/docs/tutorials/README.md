# Tutorials

Tutorials exist for one reason: to give you confidence. They are learning-oriented — designed for people who are encountering Regen Heartbeat for the first time and want to build a solid mental model before venturing out on their own. Unlike [[docs/guides/README|guides]], which assume competence and focus on efficiency, tutorials slow down, explain context, and walk through each step with care.

If you are brand new, we recommend reading them in order.

Start with [[docs/tutorials/getting-started|Getting Started]], which orients you to the system as a whole — what Regen Heartbeat is, how its pieces fit together, and how to run your first commands. This is the foundation everything else builds on.

Next, work through the [[docs/tutorials/koi-mcp|KOI MCP Tutorial]]. The KOI MCP is your window into Regen's knowledge commons — a searchable archive of tens of thousands of documents spanning forums, repositories, governance discussions, and community channels. This tutorial teaches you how to search it, interpret results, and navigate the knowledge graph that connects entities and ideas across the ecosystem.

Then move to the [[docs/tutorials/ledger-mcp|Ledger MCP Tutorial]], which covers the on-chain side of the system. The Ledger MCP queries the Regen blockchain directly, giving you access to governance proposals, ecocredit activity, marketplace orders, token supply, and more. This tutorial walks you through the most common queries and helps you understand what the data means in context.

By the time you finish all three, you will have a working understanding of the entire data pipeline — from knowledge commons and blockchain state through to synthesized digests. From there, the [[docs/guides/README|Guides]] will show you how to apply that understanding to specific tasks, and the [[docs/explanations/regen-ecosystem|Regen Ecosystem]] overview will deepen your sense of the broader world these tools are built to serve.
