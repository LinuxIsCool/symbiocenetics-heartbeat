# Getting Started with KOI MCP

*This tutorial will walk newcomers through their first KOI queries.*

## What is KOI?

KOI (Knowledge Organization Infrastructure) is Regen Network's system for organizing and searching across thousands of documents from GitHub, Discourse, Notion, Telegram, Discord, and more. The KOI MCP server gives Claude direct access to this knowledge base.

## What You'll Learn

- How to search the knowledge base with the `search` tool
- How to explore entity relationships with `resolve_entity` and `get_entity_neighborhood`
- How to get a curated weekly digest with `generate_weekly_digest`
- How to query the code graph with `query_code_graph`

## Key Concepts

- **Hybrid search**: KOI combines vector similarity, graph relationships, and keyword matching
- **Intent-aware queries**: Different intents (person_activity, technical_howto) optimize results
- **Entity resolution**: Ambiguous names resolve to canonical entities in the knowledge graph

*Detailed tutorial with examples coming soon. See the [KOI MCP Tool Reference](/docs/reference/koi-mcp-tools) for complete tool documentation.*
