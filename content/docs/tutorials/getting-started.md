# Getting Started with Regen Heartbeat

*This tutorial will be fully developed as the system matures. For now, it provides a quick orientation.*

## What You'll Learn

How to clone the repository, run your first `/current-events` search, generate a daily digest with `/daily`, and understand the character system that gives each digest a distinct voice.

## Prerequisites

- Access to KOI MCP and Ledger MCP servers (configured via `.claude/settings.json`)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `/current-events` to search for Regen-relevant news
3. Run `/daily` to generate your first digest
4. Try `/daily --character narrator` to hear a character's voice

*Detailed walkthrough coming soon.*
