# Getting Started with Ledger MCP

*This tutorial will walk newcomers through their first blockchain queries.*

## What is the Ledger MCP?

The Ledger MCP provides direct access to the Regen Network blockchain — a Cosmos SDK chain dedicated to ecological assets. Through it, Claude can query governance proposals, ecocredit batches, marketplace orders, token supply, and more without running a full node.

## What You'll Learn

- How to check active governance proposals and vote tallies
- How to view ecocredit classes, batches, and projects
- How to query marketplace sell orders
- How to inspect token supply and the community pool

## Key Concepts

- **Modules**: The chain is organized into modules (bank, governance, ecocredit, marketplace)
- **Pagination**: Most list queries support limit and page parameters
- **Denoms**: Token denominations (uregen for the native token, eco-credit batch denoms)
- **Addresses**: Regen addresses start with `regen1...`

*Detailed tutorial with examples coming soon. See the [Ledger MCP Tool Reference](/docs/reference/ledger-mcp-tools) for complete tool documentation.*
