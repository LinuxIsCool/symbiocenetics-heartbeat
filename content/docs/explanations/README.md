# Explanations

Explanations are the most free-ranging part of this documentation. Where [[docs/tutorials/README|tutorials]] teach and [[docs/guides/README|guides]] instruct, explanations simply aim to illuminate. They are understanding-oriented — concerned with the *why* behind the system rather than the *how*. You will find no step-by-step procedures here, no parameter tables, no code blocks to copy and paste. What you will find is context, narrative, and the kind of connective thinking that makes the rest of the documentation more meaningful.

Two explanations live here, each serving a different scope.

**[[docs/explanations/regen-ecosystem|The Regen Ecosystem]]** provides the broadest view. It situates Regen Network, RegenAI, and the Regen Commons within the landscape of ecological finance, on-chain governance, and regenerative culture. If you are new to this world — or if you know one part of it well and want to understand how the other parts connect — this is essential reading. It is the map that gives the rest of the site its meaning.

**[[docs/explanations/why-these-mcps|Why These MCPs?]]** narrows the focus to the two Model Context Protocol servers at the heart of Regen Heartbeat. It explains why we built them, what design decisions shaped their architecture, what trade-offs we accepted, and how they complement each other. If you have ever wondered why the system is structured the way it is — why knowledge and chain data are separated, why certain tools exist and others do not — this is where those questions are answered.

These explanations are meant to be read, not skimmed. They reward attention. And they connect naturally to the rest of the documentation: the [[docs/reference/README|Reference]] pages document exactly what each tool does, while these explanations tell you why those tools exist in the first place. The [[docs/tutorials/README|Tutorials]] teach you to use them hands-on.
