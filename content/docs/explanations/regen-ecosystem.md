# The Regen Ecosystem

This document orients newcomers to the Regen ecosystem — what it is, how it works, and where Regen Heartbeat fits into the picture.

## Regen Network

Regen Network is a blockchain platform designed to serve the planet's ecological health. Built on the Cosmos SDK, it provides infrastructure for creating, trading, and retiring ecological credits — verifiable claims that specific ecological outcomes have been achieved.

The network is not just a ledger. It includes a marketplace for buying and selling credits, a governance system where token holders vote on proposals, and a growing ecosystem of tools for monitoring, reporting, and verifying ecological outcomes.

## Ecocredits

Ecocredits are the core primitive of the Regen ecosystem. They represent verified ecological benefits — carbon sequestration, biodiversity improvements, water quality enhancements, and more.

The ecocredit system is organized into layers. Credit types define broad categories (like carbon). Credit classes define specific methodologies within those types (like "verified soil carbon increase using methodology X"). Projects register specific land areas and practices. Batches are issued against projects, representing specific quantities of ecological benefit over specific time periods.

Credits can be traded on the marketplace, held in baskets (pooled collections of credits), or retired — permanently claimed as an offset. The on-chain nature of all these operations means every issuance, trade, and retirement is publicly verifiable.

## Governance

Regen Network uses on-chain governance inherited from the Cosmos SDK. Token holders stake REGEN tokens and vote on proposals that can change network parameters, fund community initiatives, or upgrade the chain software.

Governance proposals go through a lifecycle: deposit period (gathering the minimum deposit to enter voting), voting period (active voting by staked token holders), and resolution (passed or rejected based on vote tallies and quorum requirements). The community often discusses proposals on the Discourse forum before and during the on-chain process.

## The Knowledge Commons

Beyond the blockchain, Regen has cultivated a knowledge commons — a body of shared knowledge about regenerative practices, ecological monitoring, and ecosystem design. This knowledge lives across multiple platforms: Discourse forums for public discussion, GitHub repositories for technical documentation, Notion for internal strategy and planning, and various messaging platforms for real-time coordination.

KOI (Knowledge Organization Infrastructure) indexes all of these into a searchable, graph-connected knowledge base, making it possible for AI agents and humans alike to find relevant information across the entire commons.

## RegenAI and Regen Commons

RegenAI is the artificial intelligence initiative within the Regen ecosystem. It focuses on building AI tools that serve regenerative purposes — from automated monitoring of ecological health to AI agents that help coordinate community governance.

The Regen Commons is the broader community of people and organizations working toward regenerative outcomes. It spans developers, scientists, farmers, policymakers, and activists who share a commitment to healing ecological systems.

## Where Regen Heartbeat Fits

Regen Heartbeat serves as a living pulse check on the entire ecosystem. By synthesizing data from the blockchain (via Ledger MCP), the knowledge commons (via KOI MCP), and the broader world (via web search), it produces regular digests that capture what's happening, what's changing, and what matters.

It also serves an educational purpose. By making its own structure transparent — skills, templates, character personas, MCP integrations — it teaches newcomers how to build with these tools themselves. The repository is both a working system and a learning resource.
