# Reference

Reference documentation is the most austere kind of writing. Its purpose is not to teach, persuade, or tell a story — it is to describe, completely and accurately, what each tool does. When you need to know the exact parameter name, the precise shape of a return value, or the specific behavior of a function under edge conditions, this is where you come.

The two reference documents here correspond to the two MCP servers that power Regen Heartbeat.

**[[docs/reference/koi-mcp-tools|KOI MCP Tool Reference]]** documents every tool available in the KOI MCP server — the system that provides access to Regen's knowledge commons. This includes search tools, entity resolution, knowledge graph queries, GitHub documentation search, weekly digest generation, metadata resolution, and the full suite of graph analytics capabilities. Each tool is described with its parameters, return types, and usage notes.

**[[docs/reference/ledger-mcp-tools|Ledger MCP Tool Reference]]** documents every tool available in the Ledger MCP server — the system that queries the Regen blockchain directly. This covers governance queries, ecocredit operations, marketplace data, token supply, staking and distribution, basket operations, and portfolio impact analysis. Same treatment: parameters, return types, and usage notes for each tool.

These references are designed for lookup, not for reading cover to cover. They are the kind of documentation you keep open in a second tab while you work. If you are looking for a more narrative introduction to these tools, the [[docs/tutorials/README|Tutorials]] walk you through them with context and examples. If you want to understand the design rationale behind these MCP servers — why they exist, what problems they solve, how they fit into the broader architecture — read [[docs/explanations/why-these-mcps|Why These MCPs?]].
