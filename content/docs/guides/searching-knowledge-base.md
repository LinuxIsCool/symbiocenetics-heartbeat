# Searching the Knowledge Base

*This guide will provide practical patterns for searching KOI effectively.*

## Overview

The KOI knowledge base contains over 48,000 documents from GitHub, Discourse, Notion, Medium, Telegram, Discord, podcasts, and more. Effective searching requires understanding how hybrid search works and how to formulate queries that surface the most relevant results.

## Topics Covered

- How hybrid search combines vector similarity, graph relationships, and keywords
- Using intent parameters (`person_activity`, `technical_howto`, `concept_explain`)
- Date and source filtering for temporal precision
- Pagination strategies for large result sets
- Common search patterns used in daily digest generation
- Tips for formulating queries that minimize noise

*Detailed guide coming soon. See the [KOI MCP Tool Reference](/docs/reference/koi-mcp-tools) for tool parameters.*
