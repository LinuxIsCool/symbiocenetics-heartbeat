# Guides

Guides are for practitioners. You already know the basics — you have been through the [[docs/tutorials/README|tutorials]], or you have enough experience to orient yourself — and now you need to accomplish something specific. Guides respect your time. They give you the steps to get from problem to solution without belaboring fundamentals you have already internalized.

Each guide is organized around a single task and structured to be as direct as possible.

**[[docs/guides/searching-knowledge-base|Searching the Knowledge Base]]** covers how to get the most out of the KOI MCP's search capabilities. It walks through query strategies, entity resolution, knowledge graph exploration, and the various search modes available — semantic search, SPARQL queries, GitHub documentation search, and more. If you are trying to find a specific piece of information in Regen's knowledge commons, this is where to look.

**[[docs/guides/querying-chain-data|Querying Chain Data]]** covers the Ledger MCP side — how to pull governance data, ecocredit metrics, marketplace activity, and token supply from the Regen blockchain. It includes practical patterns for common queries and explains how to combine multiple tools to build a complete picture of on-chain state.

If you find yourself unsure about a concept while working through a guide, the [[docs/tutorials/README|Tutorials]] will fill in the gaps. And if you need the precise details of a particular tool — its parameters, return types, or edge cases — the [[docs/reference/README|Reference]] documentation has the authoritative answers.
