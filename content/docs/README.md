# Documentation

This is the documentation hub for Regen Heartbeat. Everything here is organized around a simple idea: different people need different things from documentation, and serving them well means writing differently for each need.

We use the Diataxis framework, which divides documentation into four quadrants based on two axes — whether the reader is studying or working, and whether they need practical steps or theoretical understanding. The result is four distinct categories, each with its own purpose, tone, and structure.

## Tutorials

[[docs/tutorials/README|Tutorials]] are for learning. They take you by the hand and walk you through a complete experience — setting up the system, running your first queries, generating your first digest. Tutorials prioritize understanding over efficiency. They explain not just what to do, but why you are doing it. If you are new to Regen Heartbeat, or to the MCP servers it relies on, start here.

## Guides

[[docs/guides/README|Guides]] are for doing. They assume you already have the foundation and just need to accomplish a specific task — searching the knowledge base for a particular kind of information, querying on-chain data for a governance analysis, customizing a digest template. Guides are practical, focused, and structured to get you from question to answer with minimal friction.

## Reference

[[docs/reference/README|Reference]] is for looking up. These are exhaustive, authoritative descriptions of every tool available in both MCP servers. When you need to know the exact parameters a function accepts, the shape of the data it returns, or the edge cases in its behavior, reference documentation is where you go. It is structured for precision and completeness, not for narrative.

## Explanations

[[docs/explanations/README|Explanations]] are for understanding. They step back from the immediate how-to and explore the why — [[docs/explanations/why-these-mcps|why these particular MCP servers exist]], how they fit into the [[docs/explanations/regen-ecosystem|broader Regen ecosystem]], what design decisions shaped the system, and what trade-offs were made along the way. Explanations are the most discursive and opinionated category. They are where we tell the story of the system, not just document its interface.

These four categories are complementary. A tutorial teaches you how the KOI MCP works; a guide shows you how to use it for a specific task; the reference tells you exactly what each tool does; and the explanations help you understand why it was built that way. Together, they form a complete picture — one that serves newcomers and veterans alike.

Both the KOI MCP and Ledger MCP are documented across all four quadrants. The KOI MCP connects you to Regen's knowledge commons; the Ledger MCP connects you to the blockchain itself. Understanding how to work with both is essential to getting the most out of Regen Heartbeat.
