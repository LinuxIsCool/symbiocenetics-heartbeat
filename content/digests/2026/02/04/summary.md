# Summary

**Daily Heartbeat — February 4, 2026** is now available at `content/digests/2026/02/04/daily.md`.

## Key Findings

**Governance:** The v7.0 upgrade (Proposal #62) vote closes February 6 with strong consensus. Governance API endpoints experienced temporary HTTP 500 errors.

**Ecocredits:** Registry holds 13 credit classes, 58 projects, 78 batches across 5 credit types (Carbon, BioTerra, Kilo-Sheep-Hour, Marine Biodiversity Stewardship, Umbrella Species Stewardship). Most recent batch issued January 16, 2026. Marketplace remains thin with 23 sell orders.

**Chain Health:** 224.8M REGEN total supply (+61K from Feb 2), 3.37M REGEN community pool (+10K from Feb 2). Network operating normally.

**Ecosystem:** Regen expanding in Latin America with biodiversity credit innovation (Terrasos, Aguadulce Habitat Bank) and biocultural crediting pilot in the Amazon with Indigenous Achuar community.

**Current Events:**
- Carbon market projected to reach $4.98B by 2035
- CRC launched Carbon Asset NFT framework validating blockchain credit transparency
- USDA committed $700M to regenerative agriculture
- Cosmos ecosystem facing significant challenges with key project departures
- Climate tech market projected to reach $218B by 2033

**Reflection:** Regen is well-positioned for where markets are heading (quality, co-benefits, verification), but operates within a Cosmos ecosystem under stress. The v7.0 upgrade, tokenomics work, and Latin American partnerships represent the path forward.
