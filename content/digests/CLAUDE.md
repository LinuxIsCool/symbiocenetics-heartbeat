The temporal hierarchy is strict: daily digests go to `YYYY/MM/DD/index.md`, weekly digests to `YYYY/MM/index.md`, monthly digests to `YYYY/index.md`, and yearly digests to `YYYY/index.md`. This structure lets us navigate time at different granularities and makes it easy to reference historical context when generating new digests.
