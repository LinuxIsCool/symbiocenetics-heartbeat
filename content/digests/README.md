# Digest Archive

This is where time accumulates.

Every day, Regen Heartbeat reaches into the [[docs/explanations/regen-ecosystem|Regen ecosystem]] and takes its pulse. It queries the blockchain for governance proposals and ecocredit activity. It searches the knowledge commons for forum discussions, documentation changes, and community signals. It scans the broader web for relevant developments in climate finance, regenerative agriculture, and the wider Cosmos ecosystem. Then it synthesizes all of that into a single, readable digest — a snapshot of one day in the life of regeneration on-chain.

Those daily snapshots are the foundation of everything here. But the real power emerges when they compound. Weekly digests distill the dailies into patterns that only become visible across several days. Monthly digests surface the slower rhythms — governance arcs that play out over weeks, market trends that shift gradually, community conversations that build momentum over time. Yearly digests step back further still, revealing the shape of an entire season or year of ecological and institutional evolution.

This temporal hierarchy — daily to weekly to monthly to yearly — is not just an organizational convenience. It is a deliberate architecture for making sense of complexity at different scales. A single day's governance vote might seem unremarkable; the same vote, seen in the context of a month of governance activity, might reveal a decisive shift in community priorities.

The data that feeds these digests flows from two primary sources. The [[docs/reference/koi-mcp-tools|KOI MCP]] provides access to Regen's knowledge commons — tens of thousands of documents spanning Discourse forums, Notion pages, GitHub repositories, and community channels. The [[docs/reference/ledger-mcp-tools|Ledger MCP]] queries the Regen blockchain directly for on-chain state: proposals, votes, credit batches, marketplace orders, token supply, and staking metrics. Web search adds context from the broader regenerative and crypto ecosystems.

Each digest is generated from a template that defines its structure — which sections to include, which data sources to consult for each section, and how to frame the synthesis. Templates are consistent enough to make digests comparable over time, but flexible enough to accommodate the unpredictable nature of what actually happens in a living ecosystem.

Browse the archive by navigating the date hierarchy. The most recent digests are always the most interesting, but the older ones have their own kind of value — they are the record of where we have been, and they make the present legible in ways it would not be otherwise.
