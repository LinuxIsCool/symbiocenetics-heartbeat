# Content

Everything you see on this site originates here. This directory is the root of all publishable material for Regen Heartbeat — every page, every digest, every piece of documentation passes through this folder on its way to becoming a rendered web page.

Quartz, the static site generator that powers this observatory, watches this directory and transforms its markdown files into the HTML you are reading now. The structure you see here maps directly to the structure of the site: folders become URL paths, markdown files become pages, and wikilinks become edges in the force-directed graph that lets you navigate relationships between ideas.

The content is organized into two principal branches.

The [[digests/README|Digest Archive]] holds the temporal record — daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly snapshots of the Regen ecosystem, each one synthesized from on-chain data, knowledge base searches, and broader web intelligence. These are the heartbeat itself: the living pulse that gives this project its name.

The [[docs/README|Documentation]] houses everything you need to understand, use, and extend the system. It follows the Diataxis framework, which separates documentation into four distinct modes — tutorials for learning, guides for doing, reference for looking up, and explanations for understanding. This separation is not academic formalism; it is a practical recognition that people come to documentation with fundamentally different needs, and serving those needs well requires different kinds of writing.

Together, these two branches form a coherent whole: the digests demonstrate what the system produces, and the documentation explains how it works and why it was built this way. If you are new here, the documentation is the place to start. If you are returning to see what has changed in the Regen ecosystem, the digests are where the action is.
