Governance endpoints are temporarily unavailable \u2014 a hiccup in the infrastructure that handles proposal queries \u2014 but the on-chain state remains healthy with 224.8 million REGEN in circulation and 3.37 million in the community pool. Meanwhile, the broader Cosmos ecosystem faces an existential reckoning as key projects announce departures, while the carbon credit market surges toward a projected $4.98 billion by 2035. Against this backdrop, Regen's work in Latin America and the Amazon positions it at the forefront of what the market increasingly demands: ecological credits with verified co-benefits and Indigenous community partnership.\n\n\n## Governance Pulse\n\nThe Ledger MCP's governance endpoints returned HTTP 500 errors today across all Regen Network REST endpoints \u2014 a temporary service disruption that prevented automated retrieval of proposal data. This is infrastructure-level noise rather than a governance concern; the chain itself continues producing blocks normally.\n\nBased on the trajectory observed on February 2, **Proposal #62** (the v7.2.0 upgrade) should be nearing the end of its voting period, which closes **February 6**. At last check, the proposal had approximately 58,766 REGEN voting Yes with zero opposition \u2014 a strong consensus for the upgrade that brings the circuit breaker module, protocol pool, and governance-gated CosmWasm uploads to Regen mainnet.\n\nThe **Tokenomics Working Group** continues its work in the forum, refining the economic model that would tie REGEN's value to ecological credit sales rather than speculation. This thread remains the most substantive community discourse, proposing a fundamental reorientation of what the token is for.\n\n\n## Ecocredit Activity\n\nThe Regen Registry holds steady with **13 credit classes**, **58 registered projects**, and **78 credit batches** across five distinct credit types:\n\n| Type | Name | Unit |\n|------|------|------|\n| **C** | Carbon | metric ton CO2 equivalent |\n| **BT** | BioTerra | weighted 10m\u00b2 score of restoration/preservation |\n| **KSH** | Kilo-Sheep-Hour | sheep \u00d7 hours grazed / 1000 |\n| **MBS** | Marine Biodiversity Stewardship | quantified marine restoration activities |\n| **USS** | Umbrella Species Stewardship | hectare of umbrella species habitat per year |\n\nThe most recent batch issuance was **C08-001** on January 16, 2026, covering vintage years 2017\u20132022. A wave of **14 C06 batches** was issued in late 2025 (September\u2013November), suggesting active certification work in that credit class.\n\nMarketplace activity remains thin: **23 sell orders** with limited liquidity. The visible order offers 20 credits from batch C02-004 (CityForest Credits, Washington state) at $40 USDC per credit. The supply-demand imbalance flagged in previous digests persists \u2014 the infrastructure is sophisticated, but buyer-side demand has not yet materialized at scale.\n\nProjects span from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Kenya, Peru, Indonesia, Colombia, Cambodia, and multiple US states through the CityForest Credits program. The **Terrasos biodiversity units** (Tebus) in Colombia continue to represent a pioneering model: 10m\u00b2 conservation credits with 30-year commitments under a pay-for-success framework.\n\n\n## Chain Health\n\nThe Regen Network blockchain operates normally with the following vital signs:\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Total REGEN Supply** | 224,819,790 REGEN |\n| **Community Pool** | 3,368,064 REGEN (~3.37M) |\n| **Change from Feb 2** | +61,276 REGEN supply, +10,426 REGEN pool |\n\nThe modest increase in both total supply and community pool reflects the normal operation of block rewards and fee accumulation. The community pool continues to grow as a resource for future spend proposals.\n\nThe basket module endpoints returned HTTP 501 (Not Implemented), indicating this feature may not be fully deployed on current endpoints. Market trend analysis showed low activity, consistent with the thin marketplace liquidity observed in the sell order data.\n\n\n## Ecosystem Intelligence\n\nRegen Network's presence in Latin America and the Amazon continues to expand through three significant initiatives:\n\n**Biodiversity Credit Innovation in Colombia.** Regen is hosting webinars on biodiversity credit innovation featuring partnerships with Terrasos and the Aguadulce Habitat Bank. The Aguadulce \u2013 Rio Sumapaz Habitat Bank marks a milestone in consolidating Colombia's market for Voluntary Biodiversity Units (Tebu). This work directly feeds the BT01 credit class registered on-chain.\n\n**Biocultural Crediting in the Amazon Headwaters.** A groundbreaking conservation finance pilot integrates Indigenous wisdom with innovative biodiversity and cultural stewardship crediting mechanisms. The project is led by the Sharamentsa Achuar community in partnership with Fundaci\u00f3n Pachamama and Regen Network. This represents the leading edge of what the broader market is beginning to call \"biocultural credits\" \u2014 ecological value inseparable from cultural stewardship.\n\n**Regen Data Stream Tool.** A new tool integrated into the Regen App allows users to post real-time project updates and anchor data to the blockchain for verification. This enhances the MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) capabilities that differentiate high-integrity credits from commodity offsets.\n\nThe **Regen Builder Lab** (formerly Ecocredit Builder Lab) continues to serve developers building on Regen's stack, signaling a broadening scope beyond just ecocredit applications.\n\n\n## Current Events\n\nThe external landscape presents both opportunity and turbulence.\n\n**Carbon markets are accelerating toward quality.** The global carbon credit market, valued at $1.14 trillion in 2024, is projected to reach $4.98 billion by 2035 at an 18% CAGR. The shift is unmistakable: the market is smaller in volume than early projections but higher in value, driven by corporate net-zero commitments and tightening regulations. Projects with verified co-benefits command premiums that make quality-focused registries like Regen's increasingly relevant.\n\n**Carbon Asset NFTs emerge.** Carbon Removal Credit (CRC) launched a Carbon Asset NFT framework this week, introducing on-chain digital identity for carbon credits with unique blockchain identifiers. This validates the broader thesis that blockchain-based credit transparency \u2014 which Regen pioneered \u2014 is becoming industry standard.\n\n**USDA's $700 million regenerative program draws scrutiny.** The USDA's Regenerative Pilot Program ($400M EQIP + $300M CSP) for FY2026 represents unprecedented government investment in regenerative agriculture. Critics argue the definitions are too loose and the program amounts to greenwashing, but the signal is clear: regenerative practices are entering mainstream policy. Environmental credits are explicitly identified as farmer revenue tools.\n\n**Cosmos faces existential questions.** The Cosmos ecosystem is experiencing significant stress. Penumbra, Osmosis, and Noble are reportedly shutting down, entering maintenance mode, or exiting. Cosmos co-founder has declared the ecosystem \"pretty much dead\" amid funding and competition issues. Sei Network has set a mid-2026 target to fully abandon Cosmos for an EVM-only chain.\n\nThis is sobering context for Regen Network, which is built on Cosmos infrastructure. However, the Cosmos Labs Q1 2026 roadmap includes a CometBFT performance upgrade targeting 10k+ TPS and IBC bridges to Solana and Ethereum L2s. Discussions with Circle about native USDC on Cosmos could also stabilize the ecosystem if finalized. Regen's 100 active IBC channels position it to benefit from cross-chain improvements while the broader ecosystem restructures.\n\n**Climate finance shows divergent paths.** The COP30 Brazil Presidency is working toward $1.3 trillion in climate finance by 2035, while the US steps back from climate-aligned finance architecture. China is building parallel green finance infrastructure. The global climate tech market is projected to reach $218 billion by 2033. The capital is there; the question is which rails it flows through.\n\n\n## Reflection\n\nTwo days into February, the Regen ecosystem holds a curious position: technically sophisticated, ecologically diverse, and strategically aligned with where the carbon and biodiversity markets are heading \u2014 yet operating in a broader Cosmos ecosystem that is fragmenting under economic pressure.\n\nThe governance endpoints going down today is a minor infrastructure issue. The Cosmos ecosystem facing \"near-extinction\" headlines is a more significant concern. Regen has built excellent technology (13 credit classes, 78 batches, 5 distinct credit types, real Indigenous partnerships in the Amazon), but that technology runs on infrastructure whose future is uncertain.\n\nThe counterbalance is that Regen's value proposition is not primarily about being a Cosmos chain \u2014 it's about being a high-integrity ecological credit registry with blockchain verification. If Cosmos stabilizes through the CometBFT upgrade and USDC integration, Regen benefits. If IBC Eureka succeeds in bridging to Ethereum and Solana, Regen's addressable market expands dramatically. And if Cosmos truly fails, Regen's credit registry and methodology work could potentially migrate \u2014 the ecological value is portable even if the chain infrastructure is not.\n\nThe v7.0 upgrade voting closes in two days. The tokenomics working group is building an economic model that could finally create demand-side pressure for REGEN. The Latin American partnerships are producing real projects with real communities. The external market is restructuring around exactly what Regen offers: quality, co-benefits, and verifiable ecological outcomes.\n\nThe question remains the same as it was two days ago: Regen built the rails. Will the trains start running?\n\n---\n\n*Generated by Regen Heartbeat on February 4, 2026. Data sourced from Ledger MCP (Regen Network blockchain), web search, and historic digests.

The voluntary carbon credit market is valued at approximately $2.52 billion in 2025, with projections indicating it will expand to $3.04 billion in 2026 and reach $16.38 billion by 2035, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 20.59%.\n\n## Integration of Biodiversity and Carbon Credits\n\nThe carbon credit market is moving beyond the traditional focus on simply pricing carbon emissions to explicitly recognizing and monetizing verified co-benefits. This shift reflects a growing understanding that carbon projects can deliver broader social and ecological value alongside emissions reductions, with the market increasingly rewarding projects that demonstrate tangible positive impacts on biodiversity, community welfare, and ecosystem health.\n\nCarbon credits that carry biodiversity certifications, such as the Climate, Community & Biodiversity (CCB) Standards, command an average price premium of over $2.50 per credit.\n\n## Biodiversity Credit Development\n\nThe Biodiversity Credit Alliance has released its 2025\u20132026 Strategic Plan, charting a path to build a transparent, trustworthy, and high-integrity global biodiversity credit market. The plan focuses on setting science-based principles, strengthening market governance, and ensuring meaningful participation and benefits for Indigenous Peoples and local communities.\n\n## Regional Developments\n\nEurope remains a central hub for the voluntary carbon credit market, supported by stringent climate regulations and widespread adoption of corporate net-zero frameworks. Approximately 52% of European companies incorporate voluntary offsets into decarbonization strategies, while around 44% prioritize nature-based credits due to biodiversity benefits."], "durationSeconds": 7.779857762999993}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_018McE69vSc4RjuyMHbRsogX"}}

Different sources provide varying market size estimates, with projections indicating the market will expand to $3.04 billion in 2026, while others project significantly larger figures ranging up to several trillion dollars depending on methodology.\n\n## Price Segmentation\n\nThe market is experiencing distinct price tiers based on credit quality:\n- Low-cost renewable energy credits are trading at relatively modest prices, often as low as $1 to $2 per ton of CO2\n- Premium nature-based credits that deliver verified social and ecological co-benefits fetch prices exceeding $12 per ton\n- Technology-driven high-permanence removals\u2014such as direct air capture and carbon storage\u2014command staggering prices around $600 per ton\n\n## Market Maturation and Integrity Focus\n\nAfter years of criticism, uncertainty, and volatility, the market is entering a more mature phase. Integrity standards are tightening, regulators are stepping in, and the supply of truly high-quality credits remains tight. The result is a market that is growing quickly, becoming more disciplined, and rewarding projects that deliver real, durable climate impact.\n\n## Regional Dynamics\n\nAsia-Pacific is forecasted to grow at a staggering 36\u201358% CAGR, outpacing every other geography. Meanwhile, North America remains the biggest buyer base, likely capturing 30\u201337% of market share in 2026, with major U.S. corporates\u2014especially tech giants\u2014continuing to sign some of the largest removal deals ever recorded.\n\n## Key Challenges\n\nAround two-thirds of transactions still happen privately, which limits transparency and market trust.

For digest generation, you typically want complete data sets:\n\n```python\n# Get all proposals (not just first page)\npage = 1\nall_proposals = []\nwhile True:\n    result = await list_governance_proposals(page=page, limit=100)\n    proposals = result.get(\"proposals\", [])\n    all_proposals.extend(proposals)\n\n    pagination = result.get(\"pagination\", {})\n    if not pagination.get(\"next_key\"):\n        break\n    page += 1\n```\n\n### Filtering Recent Activity\n\nFor daily and weekly digests, filter by date fields:\n\n```python\n# Get batches issued in the last 7 days\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\nbatches = await list_credit_batches(limit=1000)\nrecent_batches = [\n    batch for batch in batches.get(\"batches\", [])\n    if batch.get(\"issuance_date\") and\n       datetime.fromisoformat(batch[\"issuance_date\"]) > datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)\n]\n```\n\n### Cross-Module Queries\n\nMany insights require combining data from multiple modules:\n\n```python\n# Get governance proposal with current tally\nproposal = await get_governance_proposal(proposal_id=123)\ntally = await get_governance_tally_result(proposal_id=123)\nvotes = await list_governance_votes(proposal_id=123, limit=1000)\n\n# Combine for complete governance story\ngovernance_summary = {\n    \"proposal\": proposal,\n    \"tally\": tally,\n    \"total_votes\": len(votes.get(\"votes\", [])),\n    \"participation_rate\": calculate_participation(votes, total_staked)\n}\n```\n\n\n## Error Handling\n\nAll tools return error dictionaries when requests fail:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"Query failed: Not found\",\n  \"retryable\": false\n}\n```\n\nWhen building digests, always check for errors and handle gracefully:\n\n```python\nresult = await get_governance_proposal(proposal_id=999)\nif \"error\" in result:\n    # Log error, skip this item, or show placeholder\n    logger.warning(f\"Failed to fetch proposal 999: {result['error']}\")\nelse:\n    # Process successful result\n    process_proposal(result)\n```\n\n\n## Rate Limiting and Performance\n\nThe Ledger MCP includes automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors (5xx, 429, timeouts). When generating digests:\n\n- **Batch requests** when possible (use pagination efficiently)\n- **Cache results** for expensive queries (especially analytics tools)\n- **Parallelize** independent queries using `asyncio.gather()`\n- **Use summary modes** when available (e.g., batch supply summaries)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis reference covers all 45+ tools available through the Ledger MCP. Each tool is designed to provide specific blockchain data, and together they enable comprehensive ecosystem analysis.\n\nFor digest generation, the most commonly used tools are:\n1. **Governance:** `list_governance_proposals`, `get_governance_tally_result`\n2. **Credits:** `list_credit_batches`, `list_projects`, `list_classes`\n3. **Market:** `list_sell_orders`, `analyze_market_trends`\n4. **Treasury:** `get_community_pool`, `get_total_supply`\n5. **Analytics:** `analyze_portfolio_impact`, `compare_credit_methodologies`\n\nCombine these tools strategically to tell compelling stories about the Regen Network ecosystem's growth, governance, and ecological impact.\n", "numLines": 876, "startLine": 1, "totalLines": 876}}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01TCe4ni2n6Y16rQ1VSTMP9P"}}

By Q2 2026, cross-chain governance will enable tokenized carbon credits to interact with multiple blockchain ecosystems, further expanding their utility.\n\n## Broader Climate Finance Context\n\n2026 is expected to see more innovative financing solutions enabling faster scaling of climate technologies."], "durationSeconds": 22.750822178000004}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01GwMes5ddpRM4EnPjaHZc7x"}}

For digest generation, you typically want complete data sets:\n\n```python\n# Get all proposals (not just first page)\npage = 1\nall_proposals = []\nwhile True:\n    result = await list_governance_proposals(page=page, limit=100)\n    proposals = result.get(\"proposals\", [])\n    all_proposals.extend(proposals)\n\n    pagination = result.get(\"pagination\", {})\n    if not pagination.get(\"next_key\"):\n        break\n    page += 1\n```\n\n### Filtering Recent Activity\n\nFor daily and weekly digests, filter by date fields:\n\n```python\n# Get batches issued in the last 7 days\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\nbatches = await list_credit_batches(limit=1000)\nrecent_batches = [\n    batch for batch in batches.get(\"batches\", [])\n    if batch.get(\"issuance_date\") and\n       datetime.fromisoformat(batch[\"issuance_date\"]) > datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)\n]\n```\n\n### Cross-Module Queries\n\nMany insights require combining data from multiple modules:\n\n```python\n# Get governance proposal with current tally\nproposal = await get_governance_proposal(proposal_id=123)\ntally = await get_governance_tally_result(proposal_id=123)\nvotes = await list_governance_votes(proposal_id=123, limit=1000)\n\n# Combine for complete governance story\ngovernance_summary = {\n    \"proposal\": proposal,\n    \"tally\": tally,\n    \"total_votes\": len(votes.get(\"votes\", [])),\n    \"participation_rate\": calculate_participation(votes, total_staked)\n}\n```\n\n\n## Error Handling\n\nAll tools return error dictionaries when requests fail:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"Query failed: Not found\",\n  \"retryable\": false\n}\n```\n\nWhen building digests, always check for errors and handle gracefully:\n\n```python\nresult = await get_governance_proposal(proposal_id=999)\nif \"error\" in result:\n    # Log error, skip this item, or show placeholder\n    logger.warning(f\"Failed to fetch proposal 999: {result['error']}\")\nelse:\n    # Process successful result\n    process_proposal(result)\n```\n\n\n## Rate Limiting and Performance\n\nThe Ledger MCP includes automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors (5xx, 429, timeouts). When generating digests:\n\n- **Batch requests** when possible (use pagination efficiently)\n- **Cache results** for expensive queries (especially analytics tools)\n- **Parallelize** independent queries using `asyncio.gather()`\n- **Use summary modes** when available (e.g., batch supply summaries)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis reference covers all 45+ tools available through the Ledger MCP. Each tool is designed to provide specific blockchain data, and together they enable comprehensive ecosystem analysis.\n\nFor digest generation, the most commonly used tools are:\n1. **Governance:** `list_governance_proposals`, `get_governance_tally_result`\n2. **Credits:** `list_credit_batches`, `list_projects`, `list_classes`\n3. **Market:** `list_sell_orders`, `analyze_market_trends`\n4. **Treasury:** `get_community_pool`, `get_total_supply`\n5. **Analytics:** `analyze_portfolio_impact`, `compare_credit_methodologies`\n\nCombine these tools strategically to tell compelling stories about the Regen Network ecosystem's growth, governance, and ecological impact.\n", "numLines": 876, "startLine": 1, "totalLines": 876}}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01VwCfRqssN1M436jeiWbTou"}}

Biodiversity credits are units intended to finance measurable gains in biodiversity through conservation or restoration.\n\n## Strategic Developments for 2026\n\nThe Biodiversity Credit Alliance released its 2025\u20132026 Strategic Plan, which focuses on setting science-based principles, strengthening market governance, and ensuring meaningful participation and benefits for Indigenous Peoples and local communities.\n\nIn Scotland specifically, by 2026 the Scottish Government aims to \"have fully tested options for a new ecosystem restoration code, including its objectives, ownership and governance structure, approach to monitoring, reporting and verification, and the process for nature credit issuance\".\n\n## Financing Gap and Investment Needs\n\nUNEP's State of Finance for Nature 2026 reveals that we are far off track in investing in nature to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. To meet global biodiversity, climate and land restoration targets, NbS investment must increase 2.5 times to US$571 billion annually by 2030.\n\n## Key Challenges\n\nChallenges such as ambiguous business cases, standardization issues, and market scalability prevent adoption. Additionally, there is no consensus on biodiversity metrics, but this is vital for driving demand in nature-positive financing, as businesses need standardized methods for their vast operations, making metric alignment challenging."], "durationSeconds": 74.995961656}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01EKSTR4NpAgPQktPdpxvr9c"}}

With 21 active validators and 100 IBC channels, the network showcases significant infrastructural readiness despite a lack of new credit activity or community discussions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Weekly Digest of the Regen Network Ecosystem\\n\\n## Opening Overview\\nThis week in the Regen Network ecosystem saw 1 completed proposal, 0 new credits issued, and 23 marketplace sell orders. The activity on the network indicates a sustained engagement among the 21 active validators, with 100 IBC channels demonstrating robust inter-blockchain connectivity. While total credit batches and new credits issued remained at zero, the marketplace activity suggests ongoing interest and trading potential among participants. The absence of new governance proposals highlights a period of stability, potentially allowing the community to focus on implementing and assessing the completed proposal. In summary, the current metrics provide a snapshot of activity that reflects a steady yet quiet week within the ecosystem.\\n\\n## Governance Deep Dive\\nThe Regen Network's governance activity this week was characterized by the completion of 1 proposal, with no new proposals introduced. The completed proposal is crucial as it signals the community's ability to enact changes and adapt to ongoing needs, even if specific details about its content were not provided. Completed proposals are essential to ensure that the network evolves in alignment with its mission of fostering regenerative finance and ecological sustainability. The lack of new proposals might indicate a period of reflection or consolidation within the governance framework, allowing validators and community members to evaluate the implications of recent decisions. With 21 active validators, their participation in governance is vital, as their bonding and voting behaviors directly influence the network's resilience and adaptability. This governance activity, although minimal, serves as a reminder of the importance of engaged participation in shaping the future of the ecosystem.\\n\\n## Community Forum Analysis\\nThis week, there were no new discussions or posts within the community forums, indicating a period of quieter engagement among users. The absence of dialogue can present both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, it may signify a lull in community-driven initiatives or interest; on the other hand, it allows for the consolidation of existing ideas and the assessment of the impact of prior discussions. The Regen Network's community thrives on collaboration and exchanging ideas, which are essential for driving forward the ecosystem's goals. While the silence in community discussions might raise concerns about engagement levels, it could also indicate a focus on implementing previously discussed projects. The lack of interaction emphasizes the need for the community to consider revitalizing discussions, particularly around topics such as regenerative finance, ecological impact, and blockchain governance to ensure that the network continues to progress towards its objectives.\\n\\n## Marketplace and Network Metrics\\nThe marketplace metrics reveal that there are currently 23 sell orders and no buy orders, suggesting a market that is leaning more towards offering goods or services rather than active purchasing. This could indicate a phase where sellers are testing market conditions or adjusting strategies in response to the broader economic climate within the ecosystem. With total credit batches at zero and no new credits issued, the marketplace's activity underscores a need for revitalization in credit issuance to stimulate trading activity. Additionally, the presence of 100 active IBC channels showcases the network\\u2019s impressive inter-chain connectivity, which is vital for facilitating transactions and interoperability with other blockchain ecosystems. This connectivity could be leveraged to enhance marketplace dynamics by fostering cross-chain collaborations that may lead to increased trading opportunities. Overall, while the marketplace reflects some stagnation in buying activity, the existing sell orders alongside robust IBC channels signify potential for future growth and engagement.\\n\\n## Technical Developments\\nBased solely on the data provided, there appear to be no new technical developments reported this week. The absence of updates on credit batches or proposals that address technical enhancements may point to a temporary plateau in infrastructure advancements. However, the existing framework, demonstrated by 21 active validators and 100 IBC channels, indicates that the network is well-positioned to support future developments. The completion of a proposal, which may have implications for technical improvements, could pave the way for enhancing the network\\u2019s capabilities. It\\u2019s critical for stakeholders to keep an eye on forthcoming proposals and discussions that might provide insight into future technological upgrades and infrastructure improvements that can further bolster the ecosystem's efficacy.\\n\\n## Synthesis and Outlook\\nIn synthesizing the current state of the Regen Network, we observe a landscape marked by completed governance proposals, active validators, and a marketplace that is in a state of flux. The completed proposal suggests a commitment to governance and adaptability, while the absence of new discussions indicates a potential need for renewed community engagement. Looking ahead, the ecosystem faces challenges in stimulating marketplace activity, particularly with the current imbalance between sell and buy orders. However, the strong IBC connectivity presents an opportunity to enhance cross-chain interactions that could invigorate the marketplace. To capitalize on these dynamics, the community may need to foster discussions around innovative strategies for ecological finance and collaborative projects that align with the network's core mission. The interplay between governance, community engagement, marketplace dynamics, and technical infrastructure will ultimately shape the Regen Network's trajectory in the coming weeks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Themes\\n- **Governance Activity**: 1 completed proposal, no new proposals\\n- **Marketplace Dynamics**: 23 marketplace sell orders, 0 buy orders\\n- **Community Engagement**: 0 posts, 0 discussions\\n- **Network Infrastructure**: 21 active validators, 100 IBC channels\\n\\n## On-Chain Activity\\n\\ud83d\\udcca **Regen Network 7-Day Update**\\n\\n\\n**\\ud83d\\uddf3\\ufe0f Governance Activity**\\n\\u2022 \\u2705 1 proposal(s) passed\\n  - #62: Regen Network: Software Upgrade Proposal - v7\\n\\n**\\ud83d\\udcb1 Market & Credits**\\n\\u2022 \\ud83d\\udcc8 23 sell / 0 buy orders\\n\\n**\\u26d3\\ufe0f Network Stats**\\n\\u2022 \\ud83d\\udd12 21 active validators\\n\\u2022 \\ud83d\\udcb0 106.9M REGEN bonded\\n\\u2022 \\ud83c\\udf09 100 IBC channels\\n\\n### \\ud83d\\udcca Governance Activity\\n- **Proposal #62: Regen Network: Software Upgrade Proposal - v7**: ## Summary\\\\n\\\\nThis proposal seeks to upgrade the Regen Network mainnet to v7.2.0 at block height 255...

Discovery\n- **`list_repos`** - Show all indexed repositories with entity counts\n- **`list_entity_types`** - Show all entity types (Function, Class, Keeper, Message, etc.) with counts\n- **`get_entity_stats`** - Comprehensive statistics: entities by type, language, repository\n- **`list_keepers`** - List all Keeper entities with pagination (supports `limit` and `offset`)\n- **`list_messages`** - List all Message entities with pagination (supports `limit` and `offset`)\n- **`list_modules`** - Show all modules across repositories\n\n#### Entity Queries\n- **`find_by_type`** - Find all entities of a specific type (requires `entity_type` parameter)\n- **`search_entities`** - Search entities by name pattern (requires `entity_name` parameter)\n- **`related_entities`** - Find entities related to a given entity (requires `entity_name` parameter)\n\n#### Relationship Queries\n- **`keeper_for_msg`** - Find which Keeper handles a Message (requires `entity_name` parameter)\n- **`msgs_for_keeper`** - Find what Messages a Keeper handles (requires `entity_name` parameter)\n- **`docs_mentioning`** - Find documentation mentioning an entity (requires `entity_name` parameter)\n- **`entities_in_doc`** - Find entities defined in a document (requires `doc_path` parameter)\n\n#### Call Graph Queries\n- **`find_callers`** - Find what functions/methods call a given entity (requires `entity_name`)\n- **`find_callees`** - Find what a function/method calls (requires `entity_name`)\n- **`trace_call_chain`** - Find the call path between two entities (requires `from_entity`, `to_entity`, optional `max_depth` 1-8)\n- **`find_orphaned_code`** - Find code with no callers (dead code detection)\n\n#### Module Queries\n- **`get_module`** - Get details about a specific module (requires `module_name` parameter)\n- **`search_modules`** - Search modules by keyword (requires `entity_name` parameter)\n- **`module_entities`** - Get entities in a module (requires `module_name` parameter)\n- **`module_for_entity`** - Find which module contains an entity (requires `entity_name` parameter)\n\n---\n\n### When to Use Which Tool\n\n| Use Case | Recommended Tool | Why |\n|----------|------------------|-----|\n| Find a specific entity by name | `resolve_entity` or `search_entities` | Fast label-to-URI resolution |\n| Get entity relationships | `get_entity_neighborhood` | Pre-built relationship queries |\n| List all Keepers/Messages | `list_keepers` / `list_messages` | Optimized paginated listing |\n| Complex relationship patterns | `sparql_query` | Full SPARQL expressiveness |\n| Aggregate statistics | `sparql_query` with GROUP BY | Custom aggregations |\n| Cross-entity analysis | `sparql_query` | Join across entity types |\n\n**Rule of thumb:**\n- Use **`query_code_graph`** for common queries (keepers, messages, relationships)\n- Use **`resolve_entity`** / **`get_entity_neighborhood`** for entity lookups\n- Use **`sparql_query`** for complex queries not covered by other tools\n\n---\n\n### SPARQL Query Examples\n\nThe `sparql_query` tool executes raw SPARQL against the Apache Jena knowledge graph. Common prefixes are auto-added if not specified.\n\n#### Example 1: Simple SELECT - Find all Organizations\n```sparql\nSELECT ?org ?label WHERE {\n  ?org a schema:Organization .\n  OPTIONAL { ?org rdfs:label ?label }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Relationship Lookup - Find statements about a topic\n```sparql\nSELECT ?stmt ?predicate ?object WHERE {\n  ?stmt regen:subject ?subject .\n  ?stmt regen:predicate ?predicate .\n  ?stmt regen:object ?object .\n  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(STR(?subject)), \"carbon credit\"))\n}\n```\n\n#### Example 3: Find All Messages/Keepers with Relationships\n```sparql\nSELECT ?keeper ?msg ?msgName WHERE {\n  ?keeper a <Keeper> .\n  ?keeper <HANDLES> ?msg .\n  ?msg rdfs:label ?msgName .\n}\nORDER BY ?keeper\n```\n\n#### Safety Features\n\nThe `sparql_query` tool enforces several safety measures:\n- **Max query length:** 5,000 characters\n- **Result row cap:** 1,000 rows (configurable via `limit` parameter)\n- **Timeout:** Default 30s, max 60s\n- **Read-only:** Only SELECT queries allowed (no DELETE, INSERT, DROP)\n- **Privacy:** Raw queries are never logged; only query hash + summary are recorded\n\n---\n\n### What's Currently Indexed\n\n**Repositories:** 5 total\n- `regen-ledger`: 18,619 entities (Go, Cosmos SDK modules)\n- `regen-web`: 3,164 entities (TypeScript/React frontend)\n- `koi-sensors`: 1,250 entities (Python data collection)\n- `regen-koi-mcp`: 688 entities (TypeScript MCP server)\n- `regen-data-standards`: 6 entities (JSON schemas)\n\n**Entity Types:** 10 types\n- Function, Class, Interface, Method, Type\n- Keeper, Message, Query, Event (Cosmos SDK specific)\n- Module, Repository\n\n**Total:** 23,728 code entities\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Architecture\n\nThis repo contains everything you need to run a complete KOI MCP setup:\n\n```\nregen-koi-mcp/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/              # MCP client (connects to API)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 server/           # KOI API server (FastAPI)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/          # API endpoints\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.sh      # Server setup\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 start.sh      # Start server\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 stop.sh       # Stop server\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 python/           # Weekly digest generator\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/          # Digest logic\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 config/       # Configuration\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 setup.sh      # Python setup\n```\n\n**Two modes:**\n1. **Client-only** (default): MCP client \u2192 Hosted API\n2. **Self-hosted**: MCP client \u2192 Your local API \u2192 Your database\n\n## \ud83d\udcbb Supported Clients\n\n### Claude Desktop\n\n**Recommended: Manual configuration**\n\nAdd to your config file:\n- **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n- **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"regen-koi\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"regen-koi-mcp@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"KOI_API_ENDPOINT\": \"https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Alternative: Automated installer**\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Security Note:** Review the [install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp/main/install.sh) before running.\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp/main/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n---\n\n### Claude Code CLI\n\n**Recommended: One-line command**\n```bash\nclaude mcp add regen-koi npx regen-koi-mcp@latest\n```\n\nThen manually add the environment variable to your Claude Code settings file:\n\n**Mac/Linux:** `~/.config/claude/claude_code_config.json`\n**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\claude\\claude_code_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"regen-koi\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"regen-koi-mcp@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"KOI_API_ENDPOINT\": \"https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Alternative: Use the automated installer**\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Security Note:** Review the [install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp/main/install.sh) before running.\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaiaaiagent/regen-koi-mcp/main/install.sh | bash\n```\n\nThis configures both Claude Desktop and Claude Code CLI with the correct environment variables.\n\n**Verification:** After installation, restart Claude Code and ask: \"What repositories are indexed?\" to verify the tools are working.\n\n---\n\n### VS Code / VS Code Insiders\n\n**Recommended: CLI command**\n\nFor VS Code:\n```bash\ncode --add-mcp '{\"name\":\"regen-koi\",\"command\":\"npx\",\"args\":[\"regen-koi-mcp@latest\"],\"env\":{\"KOI_API_ENDPOINT\":\"https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi\"}}'\n```\n\nFor VS Code Insiders:\n```bash\ncode-insiders --add-mcp '{\"name\":\"regen-koi\",\"command\":\"npx\",\"args\":[\"regen-koi-mcp@latest\"],\"env\":{\"KOI_API_ENDPOINT\":\"https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi\"}}'\n```\n\n**Alternative: Manual configuration**\n\nAdd to your VS Code MCP settings with the command, args, and env values shown above.\n\n---\n\n### Cursor\n\n**Via Settings:**\n1.

This is useful when:\n- Running a personal KOI instance without Regen-specific features\n- Creating a focused deployment with only certain tools\n- Disabling authentication for public-only access\n\n**Blacklist Mode** (disable specific tools):\n```json\n{\n  \"env\": {\n    \"KOI_API_ENDPOINT\": \"http://localhost:8080/api/koi\",\n    \"KOI_DISABLED_TOOLS\": \"regen_koi_authenticate,list_governance_proposals,get_validator_commission\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Whitelist Mode** (enable only specific tools):\n```json\n{\n  \"env\": {\n    \"KOI_API_ENDPOINT\": \"http://localhost:8080/api/koi\",\n    \"KOI_ENABLED_TOOLS\": \"search,get_stats,query_code_graph,sparql_query\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Note:** Whitelist mode takes precedence. If `KOI_ENABLED_TOOLS` is set, `KOI_DISABLED_TOOLS` is ignored.\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Development\n\n```bash\n# Run in development mode\nnpm run dev\n\n# Build TypeScript\nnpm run build\n\n# Clean build files\nnpm run clean\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udd0e How Hybrid Graph Search Works\n\n- Adaptive dual\u2011branch execution (internally via MCP):\n  - Focused: top\u2011K predicates via embeddings + usage + community expansion\n  - Broad: entity/topic regex over all predicates\n  - Canonical\u2011aware filtering (keywords \u2192 `regx:canonicalPredicate`) by default\n  - Smart fallback: if canonical returns 0 results, retry broad without canonical to recover recall\n- Results fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for precision + recall\n- Date filter support: when `published_from`/`published_to` are provided, the vector and keyword branches are filtered server\u2011side. If `include_undated` is true, undated docs are also included. The graph branch adds a date filter only when RDF statements include `regx:publishedAt` (optional enrichment).\n- Natural\u2011language recency detection: phrases like \u201cpast week\u201d, \u201clast month\u201d, \u201clast 30 days\u201d, \u201cyesterday\u201d, \u201ctoday\u201d automatically set a date range when no explicit `published_from`/`published_to` are provided.\n\n### Examples\n\nDirect KOI API examples (useful for testing filters):\n\n```bash\n# Natural-language recency (\"past week\") \u2014 MCP parses this automatically,\n# but you can also hit the KOI API directly for verification\ncurl -s http://localhost:8301/api/koi/query \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"question\": \"what discussions about token design happened in the past week?\",\n    \"limit\": 10\n  }' | jq '.results[0:3]'\n\n# Explicit date range with include_undated=true\ncurl -s http://localhost:8301/api/koi/query \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"question\": \"token design\",\n    \"limit\": 10,\n    \"filters\": {\n      \"date_range\": { \"start\": \"2025-10-09\", \"end\": \"2025-10-16\" },\n      \"include_undated\": true\n    }\n  }' | jq '.results[0:3]'\n```\n\nWithin MCP, the `search` tool accepts:\n\n- `published_from` / `published_to` (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- `include_undated` (boolean)\nIf you omit dates but include phrases like \u201cpast week\u201d, the MCP infers the date range automatically.\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Evaluation\n\nRun the built\u2011in harness and inspect results:\n\n```bash\nnode scripts/eval-nl2sparql.js\n```\n\n- Persists JSON to `results/eval_*.json` with focused/broad sizes, union/overlap, latency, noise rate.\n- Current baseline: 100% queries answered, 0% noise, ~1.5 s average latency.\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js 18 or higher\n- Claude Desktop or compatible MCP client\n- Internet connection (connects to hosted KOI API)\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Troubleshooting\n\n### \"KOI API not accessible\"\nThe setup connects to our hosted KOI API at `https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi`. If you see connection errors, check your internet connection or firewall settings.\n\n### \"Tools not showing in Claude\"\n1. Restart Claude Desktop after configuration\n2. Check the config file syntax is valid JSON\n3. Ensure the path to `index.js` is absolute\n\n### \"Command not found\"\nMake sure Node.js is installed and in your PATH. The setup script uses `node` command.\n\n### \"Connection error: localhost:8301\" or \"localhost:8910\"\n\n**Cause:** Claude caches MCP configurations in `~/.claude.json`. If you previously ran a local dev server, it may have cached `localhost` URLs that override your current config.\n\n**Fix:**\n```bash\n# 1. Check for cached localhost configs\ngrep -i \"localhost.*8301\\|localhost.*8910\" ~/.claude.json\n\n# 2. Backup your config\ncp ~/.claude.json ~/.claude.json.backup\n\n# 3. Replace localhost with public API\nsed -i '' 's|http://localhost:8301/api/koi|https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi|g' ~/.claude.json\nsed -i '' 's|http://localhost:8910/api/koi|https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi|g' ~/.claude.json\n\n# 4. Restart Claude Code/Desktop\n```\n\n**Prevention:** Always use `https://regen.gaiaai.xyz/api/koi` in MCP configs unless you're actively developing the API server locally.\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Example Usage\n\nOnce configured, you can ask Claude:\n\n- \"Search the KOI knowledge base for information about carbon credits\"\n- \"Get statistics about the knowledge base\"\n- \"List active Regen Registry credit classes\"\n- \"Find recent activity on the Regen Network\"\n- \"Generate a weekly digest of Regen Network activity from the past week\"\n- \"Create a digest of discussions from January 1 to January 7, 2025\"\n\n### Weekly Digest Tools\n\nThere are two tools for getting weekly activity information, each designed for different use cases:\n\n#### `generate_weekly_digest` - Curated Summary\n\nCreates a condensed, curated markdown summary of Regen Network activity. Best for quick overview and reading in Claude.\n\n**Features:**\n- Executive summary with key highlights\n- Curated selection of important discussions and updates\n- Governance analysis and community insights\n- On-chain metrics summary\n- Automatically aggregates content from the past 7 days (or custom date range)\n\n**Examples:**\n```\n\"Generate a weekly digest of Regen Network activity\"\n\"Create a digest from December 1 to December 8, 2024\"\n\"Generate a weekly digest and save it to weekly_summary.md\"\n```\n\n#### `get_notebooklm_export` - Full Content Export\n\nReturns the complete, unabridged source material. Best for deep analysis or loading into NotebookLM.\n\n**Features:**\n- **Full forum thread posts** - Complete text of all posts, not just summaries\n- **Complete Notion page content** - All chunks combined into full documents\n- **Enriched URLs** - Metadata and context for linked resources\n- **Detailed source material** - Everything you need for thorough analysis\n- Generates on demand if no recent cached version exists (takes 2-3 minutes)\n\n**Examples:**\n```\n\"Get the full NotebookLM export\"\n\"Get the complete weekly content with all forum posts\"\n\"Export the full source material and save it to notebooklm_export.md\"\n```\n\n**When to use which:**\n- Use `generate_weekly_digest` for a quick, readable summary\n- Use `get_notebooklm_export` when you need raw source content for deep analysis, fact-checking, or loading into external tools like NotebookLM\n\n## \ud83e\udd1d Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!

This is consistent with the sell orders endpoint failure. The marketplace is either entirely dormant or the data endpoint is unavailable.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways for Today's Daily Digest\n\n1. **The Regen Ledger holds 78 credit batches across 58 projects and 13 credit classes**, spanning 5 distinct credit types.\n\n2. **The most recent on-chain activity** was a C08 carbon credit batch issuance on January 16, 2026, for a Wisconsin-based project. No batches have been issued since then (22 days ago).\n\n3. **C06 (England carbon credits)** saw the most issuance activity in late 2025, with a large burst of batches issued October-November 2025 across 21 England-based projects.\n\n4. **The marketplace is currently inactive.** Zero sell orders, zero volume, zero trading activity. The sell orders endpoint itself returned a server error.\n\n5. **Geographic footprint** spans 13+ countries across 6 continents, with the largest project concentrations in England (21 projects), the United States (14 projects), and the C03/Toucan bridged VCS projects across the Global South (12 projects)."}], "totalDurationMs": 52772, "totalTokens": 106000, "totalToolUseCount": 0, "usage": {"input_tokens": 3, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 91768, "cache_read_input_tokens": 11152, "output_tokens": 3077, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 91768, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}}}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01YAZ1Q8daAAW3rUkCuB2ThK"}}

The v7.2.0 upgrade is now locked in for block 25,516,877 \u2014 estimated Monday, February 10 at 15:00 UTC, three days from now. With 68.8 million REGEN voting Yes against a negligible 63 REGEN voting No, the chain has spoken with near-unanimity: the circuit breaker module, the protocol pool, and governance-gated CosmWasm uploads are coming to Regen mainnet. Meanwhile, the broader ecosystem sits in a curious interstitial moment \u2014 the Cosmos world is both fragmenting (Sei abandoning IBC this month) and expanding (IBC Eureka bridging to Ethereum and Solana in Q1), carbon markets are bifurcating sharply between commodity offsets and premium nature-based credits, and Regen's own marketplace remains stubbornly quiet despite holding one of the most geographically diverse ecological credit registries on any blockchain.\n\n\n## Governance Pulse\n\nThe chain is in a governance quiet period. Proposal #62 cleared its voting window yesterday (February 6), passing with overwhelming consensus:\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Yes** | 68,790,406 REGEN |\n| **Abstain** | 12 REGEN |\n| **No** | 63 REGEN |\n| **No with Veto** | 0 |\n\nThis represents roughly 30% of total supply participating \u2014 consistent with the governance participation range of 22\u201335% observed across the last ten proposals. Zero veto votes signals that the community considers v7.2.0 an uncontroversial technical improvement rather than a political question.\n\nThe upgrade itself brings three significant capabilities to mainnet. The **circuit breaker module** allows designated authorities to pause specific message types during emergencies \u2014 a safety mechanism that became standard practice across Cosmos chains after several exploit incidents in 2024\u20132025. The **protocol pool module** creates a new on-chain funding mechanism separate from the existing community pool. And **governance-gated CosmWasm uploads** enable smart contract deployment on Regen, but only through governance approval \u2014 a deliberate choice to prevent the spam contract deployments that plagued other Cosmos chains.\n\nLooking at governance spending patterns, the LiquidityDAO continues to be the primary recipient of community pool funds. Five of the last ten proposals (#54, #55, #58, #60, #61) were LiquidityDAO emissions transfers, totaling 1,785,600 REGEN disbursed between August 2025 and January 2026. Combined with the Tokenomics Working Group's 500,000 REGEN grant and the X-Influencer Pilot's 129,810 REGEN, the community pool has committed approximately 2.4 million REGEN to operational expenditures over the past six months.\n\nThe **Tokenomics Working Group** discussion thread on the forum remains the most substantively active governance conversation, with 68 replies and 353 views as of February 3. The working group is pursuing agent-based modeling to simulate a fixed cap, dynamic supply model for REGEN \u2014 a direction the community endorsed in the Proposal #53 signalling vote last August. This is the thread to watch: if the tokenomics redesign succeeds, it would fundamentally reorient REGEN from an inflationary staking token to one whose value is structurally tied to ecological credit demand.\n\n\n## Ecocredit Activity\n\nThe Regen Registry holds steady at the numbers reported on February 4: **13 credit classes**, **58 projects**, and **78 credit batches** across five credit types. No new batches have been issued since C08-001 on January 16 \u2014 now 22 days without new issuance.\n\nThe geographic footprint remains impressive for a registry of this size. Fifty-eight projects span at least thirteen countries across six continents:\n\n| Region | Projects | Notable |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| England | 21 | C06 carbon credits \u2014 the largest single-country cluster |\n| United States | 14 | Spread across WA, OH, PA, VA, TN, IA, ID, TX, IL, WI, CA |\n| China | 4 | VCS-bridged via Toucan Protocol |\n| Brazil | 3 | Including USS01 umbrella species stewardship |\n| Colombia | 3 | Terrasos biodiversity credits (BT01) |\n| Kenya | 2 | C01 REDD+ and MBS01 marine biodiversity |\n| DR Congo | 2 | C01 and C03 carbon credits |\n| Others | 7 | Indonesia, Cambodia, Peru, Congo, Australia (2), Ecuador |\n\nThe C06 class \u2014 21 England-based carbon projects \u2014 saw the most active issuance period in late 2025, with 14 batches issued between September and November. This was the most concentrated batch of issuance activity in Regen's history and suggests a significant crediting pipeline in the UK that could produce further batches in 2026.\n\nThe marketplace remains effectively dormant. The sell orders endpoint returned HTTP 500 errors today, and the 30-day market trend analysis shows zero active orders, zero volume, and zero trading value. The marketplace infrastructure exists \u2014 23 sell orders were visible as recently as February 4 \u2014 but the buy side has not materialized. This supply-demand imbalance remains the most persistent challenge in Regen's operational profile.\n\n\n## Chain Health\n\n| Metric | Value | Change from Feb 4 |\n|--------|-------|-------------------|\n| **Total REGEN Supply** | 225,068,767 REGEN | +248,977 |\n| **Community Pool** | 3,410,414 REGEN (~3.41M) | +42,350 |\n| **Active Validators** | 21 | -- |\n| **REGEN Bonded** | 106.9M | -- |\n| **IBC Channels** | 100 | -- |\n\nSupply increased by approximately 249,000 REGEN over three days, consistent with normal block reward emissions. The community pool grew by 42,350 REGEN \u2014 a healthy accumulation rate that will fund future governance proposals. At 3.41 million REGEN (1.51% of total supply), the pool represents a meaningful but not excessive reserve.\n\nThe validator set at 21 active validators is small but stable. With 106.9 million REGEN bonded (approximately 47% of total supply), the chain maintains a healthy staking ratio that secures the network while leaving sufficient liquid supply for transactions and governance participation.\n\nThe 100 active IBC channels position Regen well for the cross-chain expansion that IBC Eureka promises. These channels connect Regen to the broader Cosmos ecosystem and, once the Solana and Ethereum L2 bridges go live, could serve as pathways for ecological credits to flow to where the buyers actually are.\n\n\n## Ecosystem Intelligence\n\nKOI's knowledge base has grown to **68,036 documents** \u2014 935 new in the last seven days \u2014 with the largest contributions from GitHub (37,411 documents), Notion (6,578), and podcast transcripts (6,063). The knowledge graph maps Regen Network across 7,744 occurrences and 2,903 relationships, with the Ecocredit Module (1,941 occurrences) and Cosmos SDK (1,613) as the most densely connected technical entities.\n\nThis week has been quiet on the community activity front. The KOI weekly digest reports zero new community forum posts and zero new credit batches for the February 1\u20138 period. The chain is in maintenance mode as it prepares for the v7 upgrade.\n\nThe most interesting forum threads remain the ones identified in previous digests:\n\n- **$REGEN Tokenomics WG** \u2014 68 replies, 353 views, last active February 3. The fixed cap, dynamic supply model is the most ambitious economic redesign under discussion in any ecological credit blockchain. Agent-based modeling work is underway.\n- **Framework Working Group: Progress & Why It Matters** \u2014 The work to formalize Regen's credit approval and methodology frameworks continues. This is infrastructure work that doesn't make headlines but determines whether new credit types can be onboarded efficiently.\n- **LST for Regen Network** \u2014 Liquid staking discussions from October 2025. If implemented, this would allow REGEN stakers to maintain governance participation while deploying their staked assets in DeFi \u2014 a quality-of-life improvement that could deepen governance engagement.\n- **Calling Giants: A Perpetual Berkshire-Grade Strategy for Regen** \u2014 A provocative proposal from late 2025 about building a permanent capital vehicle for Regen. The ambition-to-execution gap is wide, but the strategic thinking is sound.\n\nThe **Regen Builder Lab** (formerly Ecocredit Builder Lab) continues to signal Regen's broadening scope beyond ecocredits into general-purpose regenerative tooling. The name change itself is significant: it signals that Regen sees its future as a platform, not just a registry.\n\n\n## Current Events\n\nThe external landscape continues to develop rapidly around Regen's positioning.\n\n**Carbon market bifurcation deepens.** The Astute Analytica report projects the global carbon credit market reaching $4.98 billion by 2035 at 18% CAGR, but the more telling statistic is the price spread: commodity renewable energy credits trade at $1\u20132 per ton while premium nature-based credits exceed $12 per ton. This six-to-twelve-fold premium for quality credits is exactly the market segment Regen's registry serves. The COP30 Open Coalition on Compliance Carbon Markets, launched at Belem, is pushing for cross-border standards that would further advantage registries with transparent, verifiable methodologies \u2014 which is Regen's core value proposition.\n\n**Biodiversity credits gain institutional backing.** The Biodiversity Credit Alliance's 2025\u20132026 Strategic Plan focuses on science-based principles and meaningful participation for Indigenous communities \u2014 language that mirrors Regen's own biocultural crediting pilot in the Amazon. UNEP's State of Finance for Nature 2026 report warns that nature-based solutions investment must increase 2.5x to $571 billion annually by 2030 to meet global targets. The gap between what's needed and what's flowing creates both urgency and opportunity for platforms that can channel capital to verified ecological outcomes.\n\n**ReFi infrastructure matures.** The tokenized carbon credit ecosystem is consolidating around programmable, tradeable assets. EcoSync and CarbonCore are partnering to bridge traditional and DeFi carbon markets by Q2 2026. KlimaDAO reports all-time highs in credit settlement and retirement volumes. The thesis that blockchain-verified ecological credits will become a standard financial primitive \u2014 which Regen pioneered \u2014 is increasingly mainstream.\n\n**Cosmos fractures and rebuilds simultaneously.** Sei Network's Version 6.4 update, scheduled for this month, will disable inbound IBC transfers as Sei completes its exit from Cosmos to become an EVM-only chain. Holders must convert Cosmos-native assets to native USDC before late March or risk losing access. This is the most concrete departure since Sei's announcement. Yet the Cosmos Labs roadmap for Q1 2026 includes IBC Eureka bridges to Solana, Base, and other Ethereum L2s \u2014 potentially connecting the remaining Cosmos ecosystem to vastly larger liquidity pools. The ATOM token itself rose 2% on February 4 while most crypto fell, suggesting the market is beginning to price in the survivor premium for chains that stay.\n\n**USDA regenerative program operationalizes.** The $700 million Regenerative Pilot Program ($400M EQIP + $300M CSP) is now accepting applications through local NRCS Service Centers. The program focuses on whole-farm planning that addresses soil, water, and natural vitality under a single framework. Critics note USDA lacks the specialist workforce to implement the program at scale, but the signal remains clear: regenerative agriculture has entered mainstream US agricultural policy. Environmental credits are explicitly identified as farmer revenue tools \u2014 a direct validation of the credit-as-incentive model that Regen's registry operationalizes.\n\n\n## Reflection\n\nThree days since the last digest, and the picture has sharpened. The v7 upgrade is no longer a question \u2014 it passed, and the chain will upgrade Monday. What was uncertain on February 4 is now settled.\n\nWhat has not changed is the fundamental tension in Regen's position. The registry is sophisticated: 13 credit classes, 78 batches, 58 projects, five credit types spanning carbon, biodiversity, marine stewardship, umbrella species, and grazing credits. The geographic reach is global. The partnerships are real \u2014 Terrasos in Colombia, Sharamentsa Achuar in Ecuador, Pantanal Conservation Network in Brazil, Ecometric in England. The technology stack, about to receive its seventh major upgrade, is robust.\n\nBut the marketplace is quiet. Zero buy orders. Zero trading volume over 30 days. The sell orders endpoint itself is returning errors. The supply side has been built; the demand side has not arrived.\n\nThe external market is beginning to close this gap. Premium nature-based credits command 6\u201312x the price of commodity offsets. The COP30 coalition is pushing cross-border compliance standards. UNEP says nature finance must increase 2.5x by 2030. The USDA is directing $700 million toward regenerative practices with environmental credits as explicit farmer revenue. The capital is there, and it increasingly wants exactly what Regen offers.\n\nThe question has evolved since February 4. It is no longer \"will the trains start running?\" \u2014 it is \"which station will they depart from?\" If IBC Eureka successfully bridges to Ethereum and Solana this quarter, Regen's credits become accessible to a buyer pool orders of magnitude larger than the Cosmos ecosystem alone. If the tokenomics redesign creates structural demand pressure through credit-backed token value, the marketplace liquidity problem solves itself. If neither happens quickly enough, the window of opportunity may narrow as centralized registries and competing blockchain platforms capture the same market Regen pioneered.\n\nThe v7 upgrade is a necessary step. The tokenomics working group is asking the right questions. The external market is moving in the right direction. The next ninety days will tell us whether these threads converge.\n\n---\n\n*Generated by Regen Heartbeat on February 7, 2026.

The name change itself is significant: it signals that Regen sees its future as a platform, not just a registry.\n\n\n## Current Events\n\nThe external landscape continues to develop rapidly around Regen's positioning.\n\n**Carbon market bifurcation deepens.** The Astute Analytica report projects the global carbon credit market reaching $4.98 billion by 2035 at 18% CAGR, but the more telling statistic is the price spread: commodity renewable energy credits trade at $1\u20132 per ton while premium nature-based credits exceed $12 per ton. This six-to-twelve-fold premium for quality credits is exactly the market segment Regen's registry serves. The COP30 Open Coalition on Compliance Carbon Markets, launched at Belem, is pushing for cross-border standards that would further advantage registries with transparent, verifiable methodologies \u2014 which is Regen's core value proposition.\n\n**Biodiversity credits gain institutional backing.** The Biodiversity Credit Alliance's 2025\u20132026 Strategic Plan focuses on science-based principles and meaningful participation for Indigenous communities \u2014 language that mirrors Regen's own biocultural crediting pilot in the Amazon. UNEP's State of Finance for Nature 2026 report warns that nature-based solutions investment must increase 2.5x to $571 billion annually by 2030 to meet global targets. The gap between what's needed and what's flowing creates both urgency and opportunity for platforms that can channel capital to verified ecological outcomes.\n\n**ReFi infrastructure matures.** The tokenized carbon credit ecosystem is consolidating around programmable, tradeable assets. EcoSync and CarbonCore are partnering to bridge traditional and DeFi carbon markets by Q2 2026. KlimaDAO reports all-time highs in credit settlement and retirement volumes. The thesis that blockchain-verified ecological credits will become a standard financial primitive \u2014 which Regen pioneered \u2014 is increasingly mainstream.\n\n**Cosmos fractures and rebuilds simultaneously.** Sei Network's Version 6.4 update, scheduled for this month, will disable inbound IBC transfers as Sei completes its exit from Cosmos to become an EVM-only chain. Holders must convert Cosmos-native assets to native USDC before late March or risk losing access. This is the most concrete departure since Sei's announcement. Yet the Cosmos Labs roadmap for Q1 2026 includes IBC Eureka bridges to Solana, Base, and other Ethereum L2s \u2014 potentially connecting the remaining Cosmos ecosystem to vastly larger liquidity pools. The ATOM token itself rose 2% on February 4 while most crypto fell, suggesting the market is beginning to price in the survivor premium for chains that stay.\n\n**USDA regenerative program operationalizes.** The $700 million Regenerative Pilot Program ($400M EQIP + $300M CSP) is now accepting applications through local NRCS Service Centers. The program focuses on whole-farm planning that addresses soil, water, and natural vitality under a single framework. Critics note USDA lacks the specialist workforce to implement the program at scale, but the signal remains clear: regenerative agriculture has entered mainstream US agricultural policy. Environmental credits are explicitly identified as farmer revenue tools \u2014 a direct validation of the credit-as-incentive model that Regen's registry operationalizes.\n\n\n## Reflection\n\nThree days since the last digest, and the picture has sharpened. The v7 upgrade is no longer a question \u2014 it passed, and the chain will upgrade Monday. What was uncertain on February 4 is now settled.\n\nWhat has not changed is the fundamental tension in Regen's position. The registry is sophisticated: 13 credit classes, 78 batches, 58 projects, five credit types spanning carbon, biodiversity, marine stewardship, umbrella species, and grazing credits. The geographic reach is global. The partnerships are real \u2014 Terrasos in Colombia, Sharamentsa Achuar in Ecuador, Pantanal Conservation Network in Brazil, Ecometric in England. The technology stack, about to receive its seventh major upgrade, is robust.\n\nBut the marketplace is quiet. Zero buy orders. Zero trading volume over 30 days. The sell orders endpoint itself is returning errors. The supply side has been built; the demand side has not arrived.\n\nThe external market is beginning to close this gap. Premium nature-based credits command 6\u201312x the price of commodity offsets. The COP30 coalition is pushing cross-border compliance standards. UNEP says nature finance must increase 2.5x by 2030. The USDA is directing $700 million toward regenerative practices with environmental credits as explicit farmer revenue. The capital is there, and it increasingly wants exactly what Regen offers.\n\nThe question has evolved since February 4. It is no longer \"will the trains start running?\" \u2014 it is \"which station will they depart from?\" If IBC Eureka successfully bridges to Ethereum and Solana this quarter, Regen's credits become accessible to a buyer pool orders of magnitude larger than the Cosmos ecosystem alone. If the tokenomics redesign creates structural demand pressure through credit-backed token value, the marketplace liquidity problem solves itself. If neither happens quickly enough, the window of opportunity may narrow as centralized registries and competing blockchain platforms capture the same market Regen pioneered.\n\nThe v7 upgrade is a necessary step. The tokenomics working group is asking the right questions. The external market is moving in the right direction. The next ninety days will tell us whether these threads converge.\n\n---\n\n*Generated by Regen Heartbeat on February 7, 2026.

The v7.2.0 upgrade is now locked in for block 25,516,877 \u2014 estimated Monday, February 10 at 15:00 UTC, three days from now. With 68.8 million REGEN voting Yes against a negligible 63 REGEN voting No, the chain has spoken with near-unanimity: the circuit breaker module, the protocol pool, and governance-gated CosmWasm uploads are coming to Regen mainnet. Meanwhile, the broader ecosystem sits in a curious interstitial moment \u2014 the Cosmos world is both fragmenting (Sei abandoning IBC this month) and expanding (IBC Eureka bridging to Ethereum and Solana in Q1), carbon markets are bifurcating sharply between commodity offsets and premium nature-based credits, and Regen's own marketplace remains stubbornly quiet despite holding one of the most geographically diverse ecological credit registries on any blockchain.\n\n\n## Governance Pulse\n\nThe chain is in a governance quiet period. Proposal #62 cleared its voting window yesterday (February 6), passing with overwhelming consensus:\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Yes** | 68,790,406 REGEN |\n| **Abstain** | 12 REGEN |\n| **No** | 63 REGEN |\n| **No with Veto** | 0 |\n\nThis represents roughly 30% of total supply participating \u2014 consistent with the governance participation range of 22\u201335% observed across the last ten proposals. Zero veto votes signals that the community considers v7.2.0 an uncontroversial technical improvement rather than a political question.\n\nThe upgrade itself brings three significant capabilities to mainnet. The **circuit breaker module** allows designated authorities to pause specific message types during emergencies \u2014 a safety mechanism that became standard practice across Cosmos chains after several exploit incidents in 2024\u20132025. The **protocol pool module** creates a new on-chain funding mechanism separate from the existing community pool. And **governance-gated CosmWasm uploads** enable smart contract deployment on Regen, but only through governance approval \u2014 a deliberate choice to prevent the spam contract deployments that plagued other Cosmos chains.\n\nLooking at governance spending patterns, the LiquidityDAO continues to be the primary recipient of community pool funds. Five of the last ten proposals (#54, #55, #58, #60, #61) were LiquidityDAO emissions transfers, totaling 1,785,600 REGEN disbursed between August 2025 and January 2026. Combined with the Tokenomics Working Group's 500,000 REGEN grant and the X-Influencer Pilot's 129,810 REGEN, the community pool has committed approximately 2.4 million REGEN to operational expenditures over the past six months.\n\nThe **Tokenomics Working Group** discussion thread on the forum remains the most substantively active governance conversation, with 68 replies and 353 views as of February 3. The working group is pursuing agent-based modeling to simulate a fixed cap, dynamic supply model for REGEN \u2014 a direction the community endorsed in the Proposal #53 signalling vote last August. This is the thread to watch: if the tokenomics redesign succeeds, it would fundamentally reorient REGEN from an inflationary staking token to one whose value is structurally tied to ecological credit demand.\n\n\n## Ecocredit Activity\n\nThe Regen Registry holds steady at the numbers reported on February 4: **13 credit classes**, **58 projects**, and **78 credit batches** across five credit types. No new batches have been issued since C08-001 on January 16 \u2014 now 22 days without new issuance.\n\nThe geographic footprint remains impressive for a registry of this size. Fifty-eight projects span at least thirteen countries across six continents:\n\n| Region | Projects | Notable |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| England | 21 | C06 carbon credits \u2014 the largest single-country cluster |\n| United States | 14 | Spread across WA, OH, PA, VA, TN, IA, ID, TX, IL, WI, CA |\n| China | 4 | VCS-bridged via Toucan Protocol |\n| Brazil | 3 | Including USS01 umbrella species stewardship |\n| Colombia | 3 | Terrasos biodiversity credits (BT01) |\n| Kenya | 2 | C01 REDD+ and MBS01 marine biodiversity |\n| DR Congo | 2 | C01 and C03 carbon credits |\n| Others | 7 | Indonesia, Cambodia, Peru, Congo, Australia (2), Ecuador |\n\nThe C06 class \u2014 21 England-based carbon projects \u2014 saw the most active issuance period in late 2025, with 14 batches issued between September and November. This was the most concentrated batch of issuance activity in Regen's history and suggests a significant crediting pipeline in the UK that could produce further batches in 2026.\n\nThe marketplace remains effectively dormant. The sell orders endpoint returned HTTP 500 errors today, and the 30-day market trend analysis shows zero active orders, zero volume, and zero trading value. The marketplace infrastructure exists \u2014 23 sell orders were visible as recently as February 4 \u2014 but the buy side has not materialized. This supply-demand imbalance remains the most persistent challenge in Regen's operational profile.\n\n\n## Chain Health\n\n| Metric | Value | Change from Feb 4 |\n|--------|-------|-------------------|\n| **Total REGEN Supply** | 225,068,767 REGEN | +248,977 |\n| **Community Pool** | 3,410,414 REGEN (~3.41M) | +42,350 |\n| **Active Validators** | 21 | -- |\n| **REGEN Bonded** | 106.9M | -- |\n| **IBC Channels** | 100 | -- |\n\nSupply increased by approximately 249,000 REGEN over three days, consistent with normal block reward emissions. The community pool grew by 42,350 REGEN \u2014 a healthy accumulation rate that will fund future governance proposals. At 3.41 million REGEN (1.51% of total supply), the pool represents a meaningful but not excessive reserve.\n\nThe validator set at 21 active validators is small but stable. With 106.9 million REGEN bonded (approximately 47% of total supply), the chain maintains a healthy staking ratio that secures the network while leaving sufficient liquid supply for transactions and governance participation.\n\nThe 100 active IBC channels position Regen well for the cross-chain expansion that IBC Eureka promises. These channels connect Regen to the broader Cosmos ecosystem and, once the Solana and Ethereum L2 bridges go live, could serve as pathways for ecological credits to flow to where the buyers actually are.\n\n\n## Ecosystem Intelligence\n\nKOI's knowledge base has grown to **68,036 documents** \u2014 935 new in the last seven days \u2014 with the largest contributions from GitHub (37,411 documents), Notion (6,578), and podcast transcripts (6,063). The knowledge graph maps Regen Network across 7,744 occurrences and 2,903 relationships, with the Ecocredit Module (1,941 occurrences) and Cosmos SDK (1,613) as the most densely connected technical entities.\n\nThis week has been quiet on the community activity front. The KOI weekly digest reports zero new community forum posts and zero new credit batches for the February 1\u20138 period. The chain is in maintenance mode as it prepares for the v7 upgrade.\n\nThe most interesting forum threads remain the ones identified in previous digests:\n\n- **$REGEN Tokenomics WG** \u2014 68 replies, 353 views, last active February 3. The fixed cap, dynamic supply model is the most ambitious economic redesign under discussion in any ecological credit blockchain. Agent-based modeling work is underway.\n- **Framework Working Group: Progress & Why It Matters** \u2014 The work to formalize Regen's credit approval and methodology frameworks continues. This is infrastructure work that doesn't make headlines but determines whether new credit types can be onboarded efficiently.\n- **LST for Regen Network** \u2014 Liquid staking discussions from October 2025. If implemented, this would allow REGEN stakers to maintain governance participation while deploying their staked assets in DeFi \u2014 a quality-of-life improvement that could deepen governance engagement.\n- **Calling Giants: A Perpetual Berkshire-Grade Strategy for Regen** \u2014 A provocative proposal from late 2025 about building a permanent capital vehicle for Regen. The ambition-to-execution gap is wide, but the strategic thinking is sound.\n\nThe **Regen Builder Lab** (formerly Ecocredit Builder Lab) continues to signal Regen's broadening scope beyond ecocredits into general-purpose regenerative tooling.

The premium for verified co-benefits (biodiversity, community welfare) is creating real economic incentives for the kind of holistic ecological credit design that Regen Network pioneered.\n\n2. **Cosmos at a crossroads** -- The IBC v2/Eureka expansion to Solana and EVM chains is a major technical achievement, but the simultaneous exodus of projects like Sei and Noble to EVM-only architectures creates uncertainty for Cosmos-native projects including Regen Network.\n\n3. **Regenerative agriculture goes mainstream** -- The USDA's $700M program and major food brand commitments signal that regenerative agriculture is moving from niche to mainstream, though greenwashing concerns remain.\n\n4. **Climate finance scaling challenge** -- COP30's $1.3 trillion pathway is ambitious, but today's news about the UK potentially backing away from commitments highlights the fragility of these pledges.\n\n5. **Bioregionalism revival** -- The first Continental Bioregional Congress in 15+ years, combined with new writing on relationalized finance and tech-driven bioregional governance, signals a resurgence directly aligned with Regen Network's vision.\n\n6. **MRV technology convergence** -- Satellite, IoT, AI, and blockchain are converging to make ecological monitoring more frequent, transparent, and scalable -- exactly the infrastructure Regen Network's registry depends on.</result>\n<usage>total_tokens: 30061\ntool_uses: 8\nduration_ms: 99377</usage>\n</task-notification>\nFull transcript available at: /tmp/claude-1000/-home-ygg-Workspace-regenai-regen-heartbeat/tasks/ac811d8.output"}}

UNEP's State of Finance for Nature 2026 report warns that nature-based solutions investment must increase 2.5x to $571 billion annually by 2030 to meet global targets. The gap between what's needed and what's flowing creates both urgency and opportunity for platforms that can channel capital to verified ecological outcomes.\n\n**ReFi infrastructure matures.** The tokenized carbon credit ecosystem is consolidating around programmable, tradeable assets. EcoSync and CarbonCore are partnering to bridge traditional and DeFi carbon markets by Q2 2026. KlimaDAO reports all-time highs in credit settlement and retirement volumes. The thesis that blockchain-verified ecological credits will become a standard financial primitive \u2014 which Regen pioneered \u2014 is increasingly mainstream.\n\n**Cosmos fractures and rebuilds simultaneously.** Sei Network's Version 6.4 update, scheduled for this month, will disable inbound IBC transfers as Sei completes its exit from Cosmos to become an EVM-only chain. Holders must convert Cosmos-native assets to native USDC before late March or risk losing access. This is the most concrete departure since Sei's announcement.

The ATOM token itself rose 2% on February 4 while most crypto fell, suggesting the market is beginning to price in the survivor premium for chains that stay.\n\n**USDA regenerative program operationalizes.** The $700 million Regenerative Pilot Program ($400M EQIP + $300M CSP) is now accepting applications through local NRCS Service Centers. The program focuses on whole-farm planning that addresses soil, water, and natural vitality under a single framework. Critics note USDA lacks the specialist workforce to implement the program at scale, but the signal remains clear: regenerative agriculture has entered mainstream US agricultural policy. Environmental credits are explicitly identified as farmer revenue tools \u2014 a direct validation of the credit-as-incentive model that Regen's registry operationalizes.\n\n\n## Reflection\n\nThree days since the last digest, and the picture has sharpened. The v7 upgrade is no longer a question \u2014 it passed, and the chain will upgrade Monday. What was uncertain on February 4 is now settled.\n\nWhat has not changed is the fundamental tension in Regen's position. The registry is sophisticated: 13 credit classes, 78 batches, 58 projects, five credit types spanning carbon, biodiversity, marine stewardship, umbrella species, and grazing credits. The geographic reach is global. The partnerships are real \u2014 Terrasos in Colombia, Sharamentsa Achuar in Ecuador, Pantanal Conservation Network in Brazil, Ecometric in England. The technology stack, about to receive its seventh major upgrade, is robust.\n\nBut the marketplace is quiet. Zero buy orders. Zero trading volume over 30 days. The sell orders endpoint itself is returning errors. The supply side has been built; the demand side has not arrived.\n\nThe external market is beginning to close this gap. Premium nature-based credits command 6\u201312x the price of commodity offsets. The COP30 coalition is pushing cross-border compliance standards. UNEP says nature finance must increase 2.5x by 2030. The USDA is directing $700 million toward regenerative practices with environmental credits as explicit farmer revenue. The capital is there, and it increasingly wants exactly what Regen offers.\n\nThe question has evolved since February 4. It is no longer \"will the trains start running?\" \u2014 it is \"which station will they depart from?\" If IBC Eureka successfully bridges to Ethereum and Solana this quarter, Regen's credits become accessible to a buyer pool orders of magnitude larger than the Cosmos ecosystem alone. If the tokenomics redesign creates structural demand pressure through credit-backed token value, the marketplace liquidity problem solves itself. If neither happens quickly enough, the window of opportunity may narrow as centralized registries and competing blockchain platforms capture the same market Regen pioneered.\n\nThe v7 upgrade is a necessary step. The tokenomics working group is asking the right questions. The external market is moving in the right direction. The next ninety days will tell us whether these threads converge.\n\n---\n\n*Generated by Regen Heartbeat on February 7, 2026.

The v7.2.0 upgrade is now locked in for block 25,516,877 \u2014 estimated Monday, February 10 at 15:00 UTC, three days from now. With 68.8 million REGEN voting Yes against a negligible 63 REGEN voting No, the chain has spoken with near-unanimity: the circuit breaker module, the protocol pool, and governance-gated CosmWasm uploads are coming to Regen mainnet. Meanwhile, the broader ecosystem sits in a curious interstitial moment \u2014 the Cosmos world is both fragmenting (Sei abandoning IBC this month) and expanding (IBC Eureka bridging to Ethereum and Solana in Q1), carbon markets are bifurcating sharply between commodity offsets and premium nature-based credits, and Regen's own marketplace remains stubbornly quiet despite holding one of the most geographically diverse ecological credit registries on any blockchain.\n\n\n## Governance Pulse\n\nThe chain is in a governance quiet period. Proposal #62 cleared its voting window yesterday (February 6), passing with overwhelming consensus:\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Yes** | 68,790,406 REGEN |\n| **Abstain** | 12 REGEN |\n| **No** | 63 REGEN |\n| **No with Veto** | 0 |\n\nThis represents roughly 30% of total supply participating \u2014 consistent with the governance participation range of 22\u201335% observed across the last ten proposals. Zero veto votes signals that the community considers v7.2.0 an uncontroversial technical improvement rather than a political question.\n\nThe upgrade itself brings three significant capabilities to mainnet. The **circuit breaker module** allows designated authorities to pause specific message types during emergencies \u2014 a safety mechanism that became standard practice across Cosmos chains after several exploit incidents in 2024\u20132025. The **protocol pool module** creates a new on-chain funding mechanism separate from the existing community pool. And **governance-gated CosmWasm uploads** enable smart contract deployment on Regen, but only through governance approval \u2014 a deliberate choice to prevent the spam contract deployments that plagued other Cosmos chains.\n\nLooking at governance spending patterns, the LiquidityDAO continues to be the primary recipient of community pool funds. Five of the last ten proposals (#54, #55, #58, #60, #61) were LiquidityDAO emissions transfers, totaling 1,785,600 REGEN disbursed between August 2025 and January 2026. Combined with the Tokenomics Working Group's 500,000 REGEN grant and the X-Influencer Pilot's 129,810 REGEN, the community pool has committed approximately 2.4 million REGEN to operational expenditures over the past six months.\n\nThe **Tokenomics Working Group** discussion thread on the forum remains the most substantively active governance conversation, with 68 replies and 353 views as of February 3. The working group is pursuing agent-based modeling to simulate a fixed cap, dynamic supply model for REGEN \u2014 a direction the community endorsed in the Proposal #53 signalling vote last August. This is the thread to watch: if the tokenomics redesign succeeds, it would fundamentally reorient REGEN from an inflationary staking token to one whose value is structurally tied to ecological credit demand.\n\n\n## Ecocredit Activity\n\nThe Regen Registry holds steady at the numbers reported on February 4: **13 credit classes**, **58 projects**, and **78 credit batches** across five credit types. No new batches have been issued since C08-001 on January 16 \u2014 now 22 days without new issuance.\n\nThe geographic footprint remains impressive for a registry of this size. Fifty-eight projects span at least thirteen countries across six continents:\n\n| Region | Projects | Notable |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| England | 21 | C06 carbon credits \u2014 the largest single-country cluster |\n| United States | 14 | Spread across WA, OH, PA, VA, TN, IA, ID, TX, IL, WI, CA |\n| China | 4 | VCS-bridged via Toucan Protocol |\n| Brazil | 3 | Including USS01 umbrella species stewardship |\n| Colombia | 3 | Terrasos biodiversity credits (BT01) |\n| Kenya | 2 | C01 REDD+ and MBS01 marine biodiversity |\n| DR Congo | 2 | C01 and C03 carbon credits |\n| Others | 7 | Indonesia, Cambodia, Peru, Congo, Australia (2), Ecuador |\n\nThe C06 class \u2014 21 England-based carbon projects \u2014 saw the most active issuance period in late 2025, with 14 batches issued between September and November. This was the most concentrated batch of issuance activity in Regen's history and suggests a significant crediting pipeline in the UK that could produce further batches in 2026.\n\nThe marketplace remains effectively dormant. The sell orders endpoint returned HTTP 500 errors today, and the 30-day market trend analysis shows zero active orders, zero volume, and zero trading value. The marketplace infrastructure exists \u2014 23 sell orders were visible as recently as February 4 \u2014 but the buy side has not materialized. This supply-demand imbalance remains the most persistent challenge in Regen's operational profile.\n\n\n## Chain Health\n\n| Metric | Value | Change from Feb 4 |\n|--------|-------|-------------------|\n| **Total REGEN Supply** | 225,068,767 REGEN | +248,977 |\n| **Community Pool** | 3,410,414 REGEN (~3.41M) | +42,350 |\n| **Active Validators** | 21 | -- |\n| **REGEN Bonded** | 106.9M | -- |\n| **IBC Channels** | 100 | -- |\n\nSupply increased by approximately 249,000 REGEN over three days, consistent with normal block reward emissions. The community pool grew by 42,350 REGEN \u2014 a healthy accumulation rate that will fund future governance proposals. At 3.41 million REGEN (1.51% of total supply), the pool represents a meaningful but not excessive reserve.\n\nThe validator set at 21 active validators is small but stable. With 106.9 million REGEN bonded (approximately 47% of total supply), the chain maintains a healthy staking ratio that secures the network while leaving sufficient liquid supply for transactions and governance participation.\n\nThe 100 active IBC channels position Regen well for the cross-chain expansion that IBC Eureka promises. These channels connect Regen to the broader Cosmos ecosystem and, once the Solana and Ethereum L2 bridges go live, could serve as pathways for ecological credits to flow to where the buyers actually are.\n\n\n## Ecosystem Intelligence\n\nKOI's knowledge base has grown to **68,036 documents** \u2014 935 new in the last seven days \u2014 with the largest contributions from GitHub (37,411 documents), Notion (6,578), and podcast transcripts (6,063). The knowledge graph maps Regen Network across 7,744 occurrences and 2,903 relationships, with the Ecocredit Module (1,941 occurrences) and Cosmos SDK (1,613) as the most densely connected technical entities.\n\nThis week has been quiet on the community activity front. The KOI weekly digest reports zero new community forum posts and zero new credit batches for the February 1\u20138 period. The chain is in maintenance mode as it prepares for the v7 upgrade.\n\nThe most interesting forum threads remain the ones identified in previous digests:\n\n- **$REGEN Tokenomics WG** \u2014 68 replies, 353 views, last active February 3. The fixed cap, dynamic supply model is the most ambitious economic redesign under discussion in any ecological credit blockchain. Agent-based modeling work is underway.\n- **Framework Working Group: Progress & Why It Matters** \u2014 The work to formalize Regen's credit approval and methodology frameworks continues. This is infrastructure work that doesn't make headlines but determines whether new credit types can be onboarded efficiently.\n- **LST for Regen Network** \u2014 Liquid staking discussions from October 2025. If implemented, this would allow REGEN stakers to maintain governance participation while deploying their staked assets in DeFi \u2014 a quality-of-life improvement that could deepen governance engagement.\n- **Calling Giants: A Perpetual Berkshire-Grade Strategy for Regen** \u2014 A provocative proposal from late 2025 about building a permanent capital vehicle for Regen. The ambition-to-execution gap is wide, but the strategic thinking is sound.\n\nThe **Regen Builder Lab** (formerly Ecocredit Builder Lab) continues to signal Regen's broadening scope beyond ecocredits into general-purpose regenerative tooling. The name change itself is significant: it signals that Regen sees its future as a platform, not just a registry.\n\n\n## Current Events\n\nThe external landscape continues to develop rapidly around Regen's positioning.\n\n**Carbon market bifurcation deepens.** The Astute Analytica report projects the global carbon credit market reaching $4.98 billion by 2035 at 18% CAGR, but the more telling statistic is the price spread: commodity renewable energy credits trade at $1\u20132 per ton while premium nature-based credits exceed $12 per ton. This six-to-twelve-fold premium for quality credits is exactly the market segment Regen's registry serves. The COP30 Open Coalition on Compliance Carbon Markets, launched at Belem, is pushing for cross-border standards that would further advantage registries with transparent, verifiable methodologies \u2014 which is Regen's core value proposition.\n\n**Biodiversity credits gain institutional backing.** The Biodiversity Credit Alliance's 2025\u20132026 Strategic Plan focuses on science-based principles and meaningful participation for Indigenous communities \u2014 language that mirrors Regen's own biocultural crediting pilot in the Amazon. UNEP's State of Finance for Nature 2026 report warns that nature-based solutions investment must increase 2.5x to $571 billion annually by 2030 to meet global targets. The gap between what's needed and what's flowing creates both urgency and opportunity for platforms that can channel capital to verified ecological outcomes.\n\n**ReFi infrastructure matures.** The tokenized carbon credit ecosystem is consolidating around programmable, tradeable assets. EcoSync and CarbonCore are partnering to bridge traditional and DeFi carbon markets by Q2 2026. KlimaDAO reports all-time highs in credit settlement and retirement volumes. The thesis that blockchain-verified ecological credits will become a standard financial primitive \u2014 which Regen pioneered \u2014 is increasingly mainstream.\n\n**Cosmos fractures and rebuilds simultaneously.** Sei Network's Version 6.4 update, scheduled for this month, will disable inbound IBC transfers as Sei completes its exit from Cosmos to become an EVM-only chain. Holders must convert Cosmos-native assets to native USDC before late March or risk losing access. This is the most concrete departure since Sei's announcement. Yet the Cosmos Labs roadmap for Q1 2026 includes IBC Eureka bridges to Solana, Base, and other Ethereum L2s \u2014 potentially connecting the remaining Cosmos ecosystem to vastly larger liquidity pools. The ATOM token itself rose 2% on February 4 while most crypto fell, suggesting the market is beginning to price in the survivor premium for chains that stay.\n\n**USDA regenerative program operationalizes.** The $700 million Regenerative Pilot Program ($400M EQIP + $300M CSP) is now accepting applications through local NRCS Service Centers. The program focuses on whole-farm planning that addresses soil, water, and natural vitality under a single framework. Critics note USDA lacks the specialist workforce to implement the program at scale, but the signal remains clear: regenerative agriculture has entered mainstream US agricultural policy. Environmental credits are explicitly identified as farmer revenue tools \u2014 a direct validation of the credit-as-incentive model that Regen's registry operationalizes.\n\n\n## Reflection\n\nThree days since the last digest, and the picture has sharpened. The v7 upgrade is no longer a question \u2014 it passed, and the chain will upgrade Monday. What was uncertain on February 4 is now settled.\n\nWhat has not changed is the fundamental tension in Regen's position. The registry is sophisticated: 13 credit classes, 78 batches, 58 projects, five credit types spanning carbon, biodiversity, marine stewardship, umbrella species, and grazing credits. The geographic reach is global. The partnerships are real \u2014 Terrasos in Colombia, Sharamentsa Achuar in Ecuador, Pantanal Conservation Network in Brazil, Ecometric in England. The technology stack, about to receive its seventh major upgrade, is robust.\n\nBut the marketplace is quiet. Zero buy orders. Zero trading volume over 30 days. The sell orders endpoint itself is returning errors. The supply side has been built; the demand side has not arrived.\n\nThe external market is beginning to close this gap. Premium nature-based credits command 6\u201312x the price of commodity offsets. The COP30 coalition is pushing cross-border compliance standards. UNEP says nature finance must increase 2.5x by 2030. The USDA is directing $700 million toward regenerative practices with environmental credits as explicit farmer revenue. The capital is there, and it increasingly wants exactly what Regen offers.\n\nThe question has evolved since February 4. It is no longer \"will the trains start running?\" \u2014 it is \"which station will they depart from?\" If IBC Eureka successfully bridges to Ethereum and Solana this quarter, Regen's credits become accessible to a buyer pool orders of magnitude larger than the Cosmos ecosystem alone. If the tokenomics redesign creates structural demand pressure through credit-backed token value, the marketplace liquidity problem solves itself. If neither happens quickly enough, the window of opportunity may narrow as centralized registries and competing blockchain platforms capture the same market Regen pioneered.\n\nThe v7 upgrade is a necessary step. The tokenomics working group is asking the right questions. The external market is moving in the right direction. The next ninety days will tell us whether these threads converge.\n\n---\n\n*Generated by Regen Heartbeat on February 7, 2026.

The v7.2.0 upgrade is now locked in for block 25,516,877 \u2014 estimated Monday, February 10 at 15:00 UTC, three days from now. With 68.8 million REGEN voting Yes against a negligible 63 REGEN voting No, the chain has spoken with near-unanimity: the circuit breaker module, the protocol pool, and governance-gated CosmWasm uploads are coming to Regen mainnet. Meanwhile, the broader ecosystem sits in a curious interstitial moment \u2014 the Cosmos world is both fragmenting (Sei abandoning IBC this month) and expanding (IBC Eureka bridging to Ethereum and Solana in Q1), carbon markets are bifurcating sharply between commodity offsets and premium nature-based credits, and Regen's own marketplace remains stubbornly quiet despite holding one of the most geographically diverse ecological credit registries on any blockchain.\n\n\n## Governance Pulse\n\nThe chain is in a governance quiet period. Proposal #62 cleared its voting window yesterday (February 6), passing with overwhelming consensus:\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Yes** | 68,790,406 REGEN |\n| **Abstain** | 12 REGEN |\n| **No** | 63 REGEN |\n| **No with Veto** | 0 |\n\nThis represents roughly 30% of total supply participating \u2014 consistent with the governance participation range of 22\u201335% observed across the last ten proposals. Zero veto votes signals that the community considers v7.2.0 an uncontroversial technical improvement rather than a political question.\n\nThe upgrade itself brings three significant capabilities to mainnet. The **circuit breaker module** allows designated authorities to pause specific message types during emergencies \u2014 a safety mechanism that became standard practice across Cosmos chains after several exploit incidents in 2024\u20132025. The **protocol pool module** creates a new on-chain funding mechanism separate from the existing community pool. And **governance-gated CosmWasm uploads** enable smart contract deployment on Regen, but only through governance approval \u2014 a deliberate choice to prevent the spam contract deployments that plagued other Cosmos chains.\n\nLooking at governance spending patterns, the LiquidityDAO continues to be the primary recipient of community pool funds. Five of the last ten proposals (#54, #55, #58, #60, #61) were LiquidityDAO emissions transfers, totaling 1,785,600 REGEN disbursed between August 2025 and January 2026. Combined with the Tokenomics Working Group's 500,000 REGEN grant and the X-Influencer Pilot's 129,810 REGEN, the community pool has committed approximately 2.4 million REGEN to operational expenditures over the past six months.\n\nThe **Tokenomics Working Group** discussion thread on the forum remains the most substantively active governance conversation, with 68 replies and 353 views as of February 3. The working group is pursuing agent-based modeling to simulate a fixed cap, dynamic supply model for REGEN \u2014 a direction the community endorsed in the Proposal #53 signalling vote last August. This is the thread to watch: if the tokenomics redesign succeeds, it would fundamentally reorient REGEN from an inflationary staking token to one whose value is structurally tied to ecological credit demand.\n\n\n## Ecocredit Activity\n\nThe Regen Registry holds steady at the numbers reported on February 4: **13 credit classes**, **58 projects**, and **78 credit batches** across five credit types. No new batches have been issued since C08-001 on January 16 \u2014 now 22 days without new issuance.\n\nThe geographic footprint remains impressive for a registry of this size. Fifty-eight projects span at least thirteen countries across six continents:\n\n| Region | Projects | Notable |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| England | 21 | C06 carbon credits \u2014 the largest single-country cluster |\n| United States | 14 | Spread across WA, OH, PA, VA, TN, IA, ID, TX, IL, WI, CA |\n| China | 4 | VCS-bridged via Toucan Protocol |\n| Brazil | 3 | Including USS01 umbrella species stewardship |\n| Colombia | 3 | Terrasos biodiversity credits (BT01) |\n| Kenya | 2 | C01 REDD+ and MBS01 marine biodiversity |\n| DR Congo | 2 | C01 and C03 carbon credits |\n| Others | 7 | Indonesia, Cambodia, Peru, Congo, Australia (2), Ecuador |\n\nThe C06 class \u2014 21 England-based carbon projects \u2014 saw the most active issuance period in late 2025, with 14 batches issued between September and November. This was the most concentrated batch of issuance activity in Regen's history and suggests a significant crediting pipeline in the UK that could produce further batches in 2026.\n\nThe marketplace remains effectively dormant. The sell orders endpoint returned HTTP 500 errors today, and the 30-day market trend analysis shows zero active orders, zero volume, and zero trading value. The marketplace infrastructure exists \u2014 23 sell orders were visible as recently as February 4 \u2014 but the buy side has not materialized. This supply-demand imbalance remains the most persistent challenge in Regen's operational profile.\n\n\n## Chain Health\n\n| Metric | Value | Change from Feb 4 |\n|--------|-------|-------------------|\n| **Total REGEN Supply** | 225,068,767 REGEN | +248,977 |\n| **Community Pool** | 3,410,414 REGEN (~3.41M) | +42,350 |\n| **Active Validators** | 21 | -- |\n| **REGEN Bonded** | 106.9M | -- |\n| **IBC Channels** | 100 | -- |\n\nSupply increased by approximately 249,000 REGEN over three days, consistent with normal block reward emissions. The community pool grew by 42,350 REGEN \u2014 a healthy accumulation rate that will fund future governance proposals. At 3.41 million REGEN (1.51% of total supply), the pool represents a meaningful but not excessive reserve.\n\nThe validator set at 21 active validators is small but stable.

The v7 upgrade is no longer a question \u2014 it passed, and the chain will upgrade Monday. What was uncertain on February 4 is now settled.\n\nWhat has not changed is the fundamental tension in Regen's position. The registry is sophisticated: 13 credit classes, 78 batches, 58 projects, five credit types spanning carbon, biodiversity, marine stewardship, umbrella species, and grazing credits. The geographic reach is global. The partnerships are real \u2014 Terrasos in Colombia, Sharamentsa Achuar in Ecuador, Pantanal Conservation Network in Brazil, Ecometric in England. The technology stack, about to receive its seventh major upgrade, is robust.\n\nBut the marketplace is quiet. Zero buy orders. Zero trading volume over 30 days. The sell orders endpoint itself is returning errors. The supply side has been built; the demand side has not arrived.\n\nThe external market is beginning to close this gap. Premium nature-based credits command 6\u201312x the price of commodity offsets. The COP30 coalition is pushing cross-border compliance standards. UNEP says nature finance must increase 2.5x by 2030. The USDA is directing $700 million toward regenerative practices with environmental credits as explicit farmer revenue. The capital is there, and it increasingly wants exactly what Regen offers.\n\nThe question has evolved since February 4. It is no longer \"will the trains start running?\" \u2014 it is \"which station will they depart from?\" If IBC Eureka successfully bridges to Ethereum and Solana this quarter, Regen's credits become accessible to a buyer pool orders of magnitude larger than the Cosmos ecosystem alone. If the tokenomics redesign creates structural demand pressure through credit-backed token value, the marketplace liquidity problem solves itself. If neither happens quickly enough, the window of opportunity may narrow as centralized registries and competing blockchain platforms capture the same market Regen pioneered.\n\nThe v7 upgrade is a necessary step. The tokenomics working group is asking the right questions. The external market is moving in the right direction. The next ninety days will tell us whether these threads converge.\n\n---\n\n*Generated by Regen Heartbeat on February 7, 2026.

The v7.2.0 upgrade is now locked in for block 25,516,877 \u2014 estimated Monday, February 10 at 15:00 UTC, three days from now. With 68.8 million REGEN voting Yes against a negligible 63 REGEN voting No, the chain has spoken with near-unanimity: the circuit breaker module, the protocol pool, and governance-gated CosmWasm uploads are coming to Regen mainnet. Meanwhile, the broader ecosystem sits in a curious interstitial moment \u2014 the Cosmos world is both fragmenting (Sei abandoning IBC this month) and expanding (IBC Eureka bridging to Ethereum and Solana in Q1), carbon markets are bifurcating sharply between commodity offsets and premium nature-based credits, and Regen's own marketplace remains stubbornly quiet despite holding one of the most geographically diverse ecological credit registries on any blockchain.\n\n\n## Governance Pulse\n\nThe chain is in a governance quiet period. Proposal #62 cleared its voting window yesterday (February 6), passing with overwhelming consensus:\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Yes** | 68,790,406 REGEN |\n| **Abstain** | 12 REGEN |\n| **No** | 63 REGEN |\n| **No with Veto** | 0 |\n\nThis represents roughly 30% of total supply participating \u2014 consistent with the governance participation range of 22\u201335% observed across the last ten proposals. Zero veto votes signals that the community considers v7.2.0 an uncontroversial technical improvement rather than a political question.\n\nThe upgrade itself brings three significant capabilities to mainnet. The **circuit breaker module** allows designated authorities to pause specific message types during emergencies \u2014 a safety mechanism that became standard practice across Cosmos chains after several exploit incidents in 2024\u20132025. The **protocol pool module** creates a new on-chain funding mechanism separate from the existing community pool. And **governance-gated CosmWasm uploads** enable smart contract deployment on Regen, but only through governance approval \u2014 a deliberate choice to prevent the spam contract deployments that plagued other Cosmos chains.\n\nLooking at governance spending patterns, the LiquidityDAO continues to be the primary recipient of community pool funds. Five of the last ten proposals (#54, #55, #58, #60, #61) were LiquidityDAO emissions transfers, totaling 1,785,600 REGEN disbursed between August 2025 and January 2026. Combined with the Tokenomics Working Group's 500,000 REGEN grant and the X-Influencer Pilot's 129,810 REGEN, the community pool has committed approximately 2.4 million REGEN to operational expenditures over the past six months.\n\nThe **Tokenomics Working Group** discussion thread on the forum remains the most substantively active governance conversation, with 68 replies and 353 views as of February 3. The working group is pursuing agent-based modeling to simulate a fixed cap, dynamic supply model for REGEN \u2014 a direction the community endorsed in the Proposal #53 signalling vote last August. This is the thread to watch: if the tokenomics redesign succeeds, it would fundamentally reorient REGEN from an inflationary staking token to one whose value is structurally tied to ecological credit demand.\n\n\n## Ecocredit Activity\n\nThe Regen Registry holds steady at the numbers reported on February 4: **13 credit classes**, **58 projects**, and **78 credit batches** across five credit types. No new batches have been issued since C08-001 on January 16 \u2014 now 22 days without new issuance.\n\nThe geographic footprint remains impressive for a registry of this size. Fifty-eight projects span at least thirteen countries across six continents:\n\n| Region | Projects | Notable |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| England | 21 | C06 carbon credits \u2014 the largest single-country cluster |\n| United States | 14 | Spread across WA, OH, PA, VA, TN, IA, ID, TX, IL, WI, CA |\n| China | 4 | VCS-bridged via Toucan Protocol |\n| Brazil | 3 | Including USS01 umbrella species stewardship |\n| Colombia | 3 | Terrasos biodiversity credits (BT01) |\n| Kenya | 2 | C01 REDD+ and MBS01 marine biodiversity |\n| DR Congo | 2 | C01 and C03 carbon credits |\n| Others | 7 | Indonesia, Cambodia, Peru, Congo, Australia (2), Ecuador |\n\nThe C06 class \u2014 21 England-based carbon projects \u2014 saw the most active issuance period in late 2025, with 14 batches issued between September and November. This was the most concentrated batch of issuance activity in Regen's history and suggests a significant crediting pipeline in the UK that could produce further batches in 2026.\n\nThe marketplace remains effectively dormant. The sell orders endpoint returned HTTP 500 errors today, and the 30-day market trend analysis shows zero active orders, zero volume, and zero trading value. The marketplace infrastructure exists \u2014 23 sell orders were visible as recently as February 4 \u2014 but the buy side has not materialized. This supply-demand imbalance remains the most persistent challenge in Regen's operational profile.\n\n\n## Chain Health\n\n| Metric | Value | Change from Feb 4 |\n|--------|-------|-------------------|\n| **Total REGEN Supply** | 225,068,767 REGEN | +248,977 |\n| **Community Pool** | 3,410,414 REGEN (~3.41M) | +42,350 |\n| **Active Validators** | 21 | -- |\n| **REGEN Bonded** | 106.9M | -- |\n| **IBC Channels** | 100 | -- |\n\nSupply increased by approximately 249,000 REGEN over three days, consistent with normal block reward emissions. The community pool grew by 42,350 REGEN \u2014 a healthy accumulation rate that will fund future governance proposals. At 3.41 million REGEN (1.51% of total supply), the pool represents a meaningful but not excessive reserve.\n\nThe validator set at 21 active validators is small but stable. With 106.9 million REGEN bonded (approximately 47% of total supply), the chain maintains a healthy staking ratio that secures the network while leaving sufficient liquid supply for transactions and governance participation.\n\nThe 100 active IBC channels position Regen well for the cross-chain expansion that IBC Eureka promises. These channels connect Regen to the broader Cosmos ecosystem and, once the Solana and Ethereum L2 bridges go live, could serve as pathways for ecological credits to flow to where the buyers actually are.\n\n\n## Ecosystem Intelligence\n\nKOI's knowledge base has grown to **68,036 documents** \u2014 935 new in the last seven days \u2014 with the largest contributions from GitHub (37,411 documents), Notion (6,578), and podcast transcripts (6,063). The knowledge graph maps Regen Network across 7,744 occurrences and 2,903 relationships, with the Ecocredit Module (1,941 occurrences) and Cosmos SDK (1,613) as the most densely connected technical entities.\n\nThis week has been quiet on the community activity front.

The v7.2.0 upgrade is now locked in for block 25,516,877 \u2014 estimated Monday, February 10 at 15:00 UTC, three days from now. With 68.8 million REGEN voting Yes against a negligible 63 REGEN voting No, the chain has spoken with near-unanimity: the circuit breaker module, the protocol pool, and governance-gated CosmWasm uploads are coming to Regen mainnet. Meanwhile, the broader ecosystem sits in a curious interstitial moment \u2014 the Cosmos world is both fragmenting (Sei abandoning IBC this month) and expanding (IBC Eureka bridging to Ethereum and Solana in Q1), carbon markets are bifurcating sharply between commodity offsets and premium nature-based credits, and Regen's own marketplace remains stubbornly quiet despite holding one of the most geographically diverse ecological credit registries on any blockchain.\n\n\n## Governance Pulse\n\nThe chain is in a governance quiet period. Proposal #62 cleared its voting window yesterday (February 6), passing with overwhelming consensus:\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Yes** | 68,790,406 REGEN |\n| **Abstain** | 12 REGEN |\n| **No** | 63 REGEN |\n| **No with Veto** | 0 |\n\nThis represents roughly 30% of total supply participating \u2014 consistent with the governance participation range of 22\u201335% observed across the last ten proposals. Zero veto votes signals that the community considers v7.2.0 an uncontroversial technical improvement rather than a political question.\n\nThe upgrade itself brings three significant capabilities to mainnet. The **circuit breaker module** allows designated authorities to pause specific message types during emergencies \u2014 a safety mechanism that became standard practice across Cosmos chains after several exploit incidents in 2024\u20132025. The **protocol pool module** creates a new on-chain funding mechanism separate from the existing community pool. And **governance-gated CosmWasm uploads** enable smart contract deployment on Regen, but only through governance approval \u2014 a deliberate choice to prevent the spam contract deployments that plagued other Cosmos chains.\n\nLooking at governance spending patterns, the LiquidityDAO continues to be the primary recipient of community pool funds. Five of the last ten proposals (#54, #55, #58, #60, #61) were LiquidityDAO emissions transfers, totaling 1,785,600 REGEN disbursed between August 2025 and January 2026. Combined with the Tokenomics Working Group's 500,000 REGEN grant and the X-Influencer Pilot's 129,810 REGEN, the community pool has committed approximately 2.4 million REGEN to operational expenditures over the past six months.\n\nThe **Tokenomics Working Group** discussion thread on the forum remains the most substantively active governance conversation, with 68 replies and 353 views as of February 3. The working group is pursuing agent-based modeling to simulate a fixed cap, dynamic supply model for REGEN \u2014 a direction the community endorsed in the Proposal #53 signalling vote last August. This is the thread to watch: if the tokenomics redesign succeeds, it would fundamentally reorient REGEN from an inflationary staking token to one whose value is structurally tied to ecological credit demand.\n\n\n## Ecocredit Activity\n\nThe Regen Registry holds steady at the numbers reported on February 4: **13 credit classes**, **58 projects**, and **78 credit batches** across five credit types. No new batches have been issued since C08-001 on January 16 \u2014 now 22 days without new issuance.\n\nThe geographic footprint remains impressive for a registry of this size. Fifty-eight projects span at least thirteen countries across six continents:\n\n| Region | Projects | Notable |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| England | 21 | C06 carbon credits \u2014 the largest single-country cluster |\n| United States | 14 | Spread across WA, OH, PA, VA, TN, IA, ID, TX, IL, WI, CA |\n| China | 4 | VCS-bridged via Toucan Protocol |\n| Brazil | 3 | Including USS01 umbrella species stewardship |\n| Colombia | 3 | Terrasos biodiversity credits (BT01) |\n| Kenya | 2 | C01 REDD+ and MBS01 marine biodiversity |\n| DR Congo | 2 | C01 and C03 carbon credits |\n| Others | 7 | Indonesia, Cambodia, Peru, Congo, Australia (2), Ecuador |\n\nThe C06 class \u2014 21 England-based carbon projects \u2014 saw the most active issuance period in late 2025, with 14 batches issued between September and November. This was the most concentrated batch of issuance activity in Regen's history and suggests a significant crediting pipeline in the UK that could produce further batches in 2026.\n\nThe marketplace remains effectively dormant. The sell orders endpoint returned HTTP 500 errors today, and the 30-day market trend analysis shows zero active orders, zero volume, and zero trading value. The marketplace infrastructure exists \u2014 23 sell orders were visible as recently as February 4 \u2014 but the buy side has not materialized. This supply-demand imbalance remains the most persistent challenge in Regen's operational profile.\n\n\n## Chain Health\n\n| Metric | Value | Change from Feb 4 |\n|--------|-------|-------------------|\n| **Total REGEN Supply** | 225,068,767 REGEN | +248,977 |\n| **Community Pool** | 3,410,414 REGEN (~3.41M) | +42,350 |\n| **Active Validators** | 21 | -- |\n| **REGEN Bonded** | 106.9M | -- |\n| **IBC Channels** | 100 | -- |\n\nSupply increased by approximately 249,000 REGEN over three days, consistent with normal block reward emissions. The community pool grew by 42,350 REGEN \u2014 a healthy accumulation rate that will fund future governance proposals. At 3.41 million REGEN (1.51% of total supply), the pool represents a meaningful but not excessive reserve.\n\nThe validator set at 21 active validators is small but stable. With 106.9 million REGEN bonded (approximately 47% of total supply), the chain maintains a healthy staking ratio that secures the network while leaving sufficient liquid supply for transactions and governance participation.\n\nThe REGEN token trades at approximately $0.0038, with a live market cap around $559,000 \u2014 a figure that reflects the token's current status as a governance and staking asset rather than a value-accrual mechanism. Trading volume saw a 113% spike in the last 24 hours, though the price declined 16% over the past seven days. These microcap dynamics are noise; the structural question remains whether the Tokenomics Working Group's redesign can create a durable link between credit sales and token value.\n\nThe 100 active IBC channels position Regen well for the cross-chain expansion that IBC Eureka promises. These channels connect Regen to the broader Cosmos ecosystem and, once the Solana and Ethereum L2 bridges go live, could serve as pathways for ecological credits to flow to where the buyers actually are. Noble's impending migration to an EVM L1 \u2014 Noble being the primary USDC issuance chain for Cosmos \u2014 does raise the question of how Regen will handle stablecoin settlement if the Cosmos-native USDC pathway changes. This is worth watching closely over the next six weeks.\n\n\n## Ecosystem Intelligence\n\nKOI's knowledge base has grown to **68,036 documents** \u2014 935 new in the last seven days \u2014 with the largest contributions from GitHub (37,411 documents), Notion (6,578), and podcast transcripts (6,063). The knowledge graph maps Regen Network across 7,744 occurrences and 2,903 relationships, with the Ecocredit Module (1,941 occurrences) and Cosmos SDK (1,613) as the most densely connected technical entities.\n\nThis week has been quiet on the community activity front. The KOI weekly digest reports zero new community forum posts and zero new credit batches for the February 1\u20138 period. The chain is in maintenance mode as it prepares for the v7 upgrade.\n\nThe most interesting forum threads remain the ones identified in previous digests:\n\n- **$REGEN Tokenomics WG** \u2014 68 replies, 353 views, last active February 3. The fixed cap, dynamic supply model is the most ambitious economic redesign under discussion in any ecological credit blockchain. Agent-based modeling work is underway.\n- **Framework Working Group: Progress & Why It Matters** \u2014 The work to formalize Regen's credit approval and methodology frameworks continues. This is infrastructure work that doesn't make headlines but determines whether new credit types can be onboarded efficiently.\n- **LST for Regen Network** \u2014 Liquid staking discussions from October 2025. If implemented, this would allow REGEN stakers to maintain governance participation while deploying their staked assets in DeFi \u2014 a quality-of-life improvement that could deepen governance engagement.\n- **Calling Giants: A Perpetual Berkshire-Grade Strategy for Regen** \u2014 A provocative proposal from late 2025 about building a permanent capital vehicle for Regen. The ambition-to-execution gap is wide, but the strategic thinking is sound.\n\nThe **Regen Builder Lab** (formerly Ecocredit Builder Lab) continues to signal Regen's broadening scope beyond ecocredits into general-purpose regenerative tooling. The name change itself is significant: it signals that Regen sees its future as a platform, not just a registry.\n\n\n## Current Events\n\nThe external landscape continues to develop rapidly around Regen's positioning.\n\n**Carbon market bifurcation deepens.** The Astute Analytica report projects the global carbon credit market reaching $4.98 billion by 2035 at 18% CAGR, but the more telling statistic is the price spread: commodity renewable energy credits trade at $1\u20132 per ton while premium nature-based credits exceed $12 per ton. This six-to-twelve-fold premium for quality credits is exactly the market segment Regen's registry serves. The COP30 Open Coalition on Compliance Carbon Markets, launched at Belem, is pushing for cross-border standards that would further advantage registries with transparent, verifiable methodologies \u2014 which is Regen's core value proposition.\n\n**Biodiversity credits gain institutional backing.** The Biodiversity Credit Alliance's 2025\u20132026 Strategic Plan focuses on science-based principles and meaningful participation for Indigenous communities \u2014 language that mirrors Regen's own biocultural crediting pilot in the Amazon. UNEP's State of Finance for Nature 2026 report warns that nature-based solutions investment must increase 2.5x to $571 billion annually by 2030 to meet global targets. The gap between what's needed and what's flowing creates both urgency and opportunity for platforms that can channel capital to verified ecological outcomes.\n\n**ReFi infrastructure matures.** The tokenized carbon credit ecosystem is consolidating around programmable, tradeable assets. EcoSync and CarbonCore are partnering to bridge traditional and DeFi carbon markets by Q2 2026. KlimaDAO reports all-time highs in credit settlement and retirement volumes. The thesis that blockchain-verified ecological credits will become a standard financial primitive \u2014 which Regen pioneered \u2014 is increasingly mainstream.\n\n**Cosmos fractures and rebuilds simultaneously.** The exodus is accelerating. Sei Network's Version 6.4 update, scheduled for this month, will disable inbound IBC transfers as Sei completes its exit to become an EVM-only chain. Noble \u2014 the USDC issuance chain for Cosmos \u2014 has announced its own migration to an EVM L1, launching March 18. Holders must convert Cosmos-native assets before late March or risk losing access. These are not peripheral projects; Noble handles the stablecoin infrastructure that much of Cosmos depends on. Yet the Cosmos Labs roadmap for Q1 2026 includes IBC Eureka bridges to Solana, Base, and other Ethereum L2s \u2014 potentially connecting the remaining Cosmos ecosystem to vastly larger liquidity pools. The ATOM token itself rose 2% on February 4 while most crypto fell, suggesting the market is beginning to price in the survivor premium for chains that stay.\n\n**USDA regenerative program operationalizes, and food brands follow.** The $700 million Regenerative Pilot Program ($400M EQIP + $300M CSP) is now accepting applications through local NRCS Service Centers. The program focuses on whole-farm planning that addresses soil, water, and natural vitality under a single framework. Critics note USDA lacks the specialist workforce to implement the program at scale, but the signal extends beyond policy: King Arthur Baking Co. committed this week to sourcing 100% of its flour from regeneratively grown wheat by 2030, alongside Cairnspring Mills and Simple Mills demonstrating that regenerative sourcing works as a business model, not just a sustainability claim. Environmental credits are explicitly identified as farmer revenue tools in the USDA program \u2014 a direct validation of the credit-as-incentive model that Regen's registry operationalizes.\n\n**Climate finance commitments waver.** Reports emerged today that the UK may be reconsidering its pledge to triple climate financing for poorer countries \u2014 a cornerstone of the COP30 $1.3 trillion pathway agreed at Belem. If confirmed, this would be the first major defection from the COP30 framework and raises questions about whether the ambitious financing targets that create demand for ecological credits will actually materialize. Moody's projects $530 billion in green bonds and $190 billion in sustainability bonds for 2026, but these projections assume political commitments hold.\n\n**Bioregionalism stirs.** For the first time in over fifteen years, bioregionalists across North America are organizing a Continental Bioregional Congress \u2014 a gathering of organizers, artists, land stewards, and community leaders from the US, Canada, and Mexico. The timing is not coincidental. As the climate crisis deepens, the bioregional framework that Regen Network embodies \u2014 organizing economic and ecological activity around watersheds and ecosystems rather than political boundaries \u2014 is experiencing a genuine intellectual revival. A recent piece on Resilience.org explores how finance can be conjoined with a bioregion's watersheds, forests, and arable land, articulating the theoretical basis for exactly the kind of place-based ecological crediting that Regen's registry enables.\n\n\n## Reflection\n\nThree days since the last digest, and the picture has sharpened. The v7 upgrade is no longer a question \u2014 it passed, and the chain will upgrade Monday. What was uncertain on February 4 is now settled.\n\nWhat has not changed is the fundamental tension in Regen's position. The registry is sophisticated: 13 credit classes, 78 batches, 58 projects, five credit types spanning carbon, biodiversity, marine stewardship, umbrella species, and grazing credits. The geographic reach is global. The partnerships are real \u2014 Terrasos in Colombia, Sharamentsa Achuar in Ecuador, Pantanal Conservation Network in Brazil, Ecometric in England. The technology stack, about to receive its seventh major upgrade, is robust.\n\nBut the marketplace is quiet. Zero buy orders. Zero trading volume over 30 days. The sell orders endpoint itself is returning errors. The supply side has been built; the demand side has not arrived.\n\nThe external market is beginning to close this gap. Premium nature-based credits command 6\u201312x the price of commodity offsets. The COP30 coalition is pushing cross-border compliance standards. UNEP says nature finance must increase 2.5x by 2030. The USDA is directing $700 million toward regenerative practices with environmental credits as explicit farmer revenue. The capital is there, and it increasingly wants exactly what Regen offers.\n\nThe question has evolved since February 4. It is no longer \"will the trains start running?\" \u2014 it is \"which station will they depart from?\" If IBC Eureka successfully bridges to Ethereum and Solana this quarter, Regen's credits become accessible to a buyer pool orders of magnitude larger than the Cosmos ecosystem alone. If the tokenomics redesign creates structural demand pressure through credit-backed token value, the marketplace liquidity problem solves itself. If neither happens quickly enough, the window of opportunity may narrow as centralized registries and competing blockchain platforms capture the same market Regen pioneered.\n\nThe v7 upgrade is a necessary step. The tokenomics working group is asking the right questions. The external market is moving in the right direction. The next ninety days will tell us whether these threads converge.\n\n---\n\n*Generated by Regen Heartbeat on February 7, 2026.

The v7.2.0 upgrade is now locked in for block 25,516,877 \u2014 estimated Monday, February 10 at 15:00 UTC, three days from now. With 68.8 million REGEN voting Yes against a negligible 63 REGEN voting No, the chain has spoken with near-unanimity: the circuit breaker module, the protocol pool, and governance-gated CosmWasm uploads are coming to Regen mainnet. Meanwhile, the broader ecosystem sits in a curious interstitial moment \u2014 the Cosmos world is both fragmenting (Sei abandoning IBC this month) and expanding (IBC Eureka bridging to Ethereum and Solana in Q1), carbon markets are bifurcating sharply between commodity offsets and premium nature-based credits, and Regen's own marketplace remains stubbornly quiet despite holding one of the most geographically diverse ecological credit registries on any blockchain.\n\n\n## Governance Pulse\n\nThe chain is in a governance quiet period. Proposal #62 cleared its voting window yesterday (February 6), passing with overwhelming consensus:\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Yes** | 68,790,406 REGEN |\n| **Abstain** | 12 REGEN |\n| **No** | 63 REGEN |\n| **No with Veto** | 0 |\n\nThis represents roughly 30% of total supply participating \u2014 consistent with the governance participation range of 22\u201335% observed across the last ten proposals. Zero veto votes signals that the community considers v7.2.0 an uncontroversial technical improvement rather than a political question.\n\nThe upgrade itself brings three significant capabilities to mainnet. The **circuit breaker module** allows designated authorities to pause specific message types during emergencies \u2014 a safety mechanism that became standard practice across Cosmos chains after several exploit incidents in 2024\u20132025. The **protocol pool module** creates a new on-chain funding mechanism separate from the existing community pool. And **governance-gated CosmWasm uploads** enable smart contract deployment on Regen, but only through governance approval \u2014 a deliberate choice to prevent the spam contract deployments that plagued other Cosmos chains.\n\nLooking at governance spending patterns, the LiquidityDAO continues to be the primary recipient of community pool funds. Five of the last ten proposals (#54, #55, #58, #60, #61) were LiquidityDAO emissions transfers, totaling 1,785,600 REGEN disbursed between August 2025 and January 2026. Combined with the Tokenomics Working Group's 500,000 REGEN grant and the X-Influencer Pilot's 129,810 REGEN, the community pool has committed approximately 2.4 million REGEN to operational expenditures over the past six months.\n\nThe **Tokenomics Working Group** discussion thread on the forum remains the most substantively active governance conversation, with 68 replies and 353 views as of February 3. The working group is pursuing agent-based modeling to simulate a fixed cap, dynamic supply model for REGEN \u2014 a direction the community endorsed in the Proposal #53 signalling vote last August. This is the thread to watch: if the tokenomics redesign succeeds, it would fundamentally reorient REGEN from an inflationary staking token to one whose value is structurally tied to ecological credit demand.\n\n\n## Ecocredit Activity\n\nThe Regen Registry holds steady at the numbers reported on February 4: **13 credit classes**, **58 projects**, and **78 credit batches** across five credit types. No new batches have been issued since C08-001 on January 16 \u2014 now 22 days without new issuance.\n\nThe geographic footprint remains impressive for a registry of this size. Fifty-eight projects span at least thirteen countries across six continents:\n\n| Region | Projects | Notable |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| England | 21 | C06 carbon credits \u2014 the largest single-country cluster |\n| United States | 14 | Spread across WA, OH, PA, VA, TN, IA, ID, TX, IL, WI, CA |\n| China | 4 | VCS-bridged via Toucan Protocol |\n| Brazil | 3 | Including USS01 umbrella species stewardship |\n| Colombia | 3 | Terrasos biodiversity credits (BT01) |\n| Kenya | 2 | C01 REDD+ and MBS01 marine biodiversity |\n| DR Congo | 2 | C01 and C03 carbon credits |\n| Others | 7 | Indonesia, Cambodia, Peru, Congo, Australia (2), Ecuador |\n\nThe C06 class \u2014 21 England-based carbon projects \u2014 saw the most active issuance period in late 2025, with 14 batches issued between September and November. This was the most concentrated batch of issuance activity in Regen's history and suggests a significant crediting pipeline in the UK that could produce further batches in 2026.\n\nThe marketplace remains effectively dormant. The sell orders endpoint returned HTTP 500 errors today, and the 30-day market trend analysis shows zero active orders, zero volume, and zero trading value. The marketplace infrastructure exists \u2014 23 sell orders were visible as recently as February 4 \u2014 but the buy side has not materialized. This supply-demand imbalance remains the most persistent challenge in Regen's operational profile.\n\n\n## Chain Health\n\n| Metric | Value | Change from Feb 4 |\n|--------|-------|-------------------|\n| **Total REGEN Supply** | 225,068,767 REGEN | +248,977 |\n| **Community Pool** | 3,410,414 REGEN (~3.41M) | +42,350 |\n| **Active Validators** | 21 | -- |\n| **REGEN Bonded** | 106.9M | -- |\n| **IBC Channels** | 100 | -- |\n\nSupply increased by approximately 249,000 REGEN over three days, consistent with normal block reward emissions. The community pool grew by 42,350 REGEN \u2014 a healthy accumulation rate that will fund future governance proposals. At 3.41 million REGEN (1.51% of total supply), the pool represents a meaningful but not excessive reserve.\n\nThe validator set at 21 active validators is small but stable. With 106.9 million REGEN bonded (approximately 47% of total supply), the chain maintains a healthy staking ratio that secures the network while leaving sufficient liquid supply for transactions and governance participation.\n\nThe REGEN token trades at approximately $0.0038, with a live market cap around $559,000 \u2014 a figure that reflects the token's current status as a governance and staking asset rather than a value-accrual mechanism. Trading volume saw a 113% spike in the last 24 hours, though the price declined 16% over the past seven days. These microcap dynamics are noise; the structural question remains whether the Tokenomics Working Group's redesign can create a durable link between credit sales and token value.\n\nThe 100 active IBC channels position Regen well for the cross-chain expansion that IBC Eureka promises. These channels connect Regen to the broader Cosmos ecosystem and, once the Solana and Ethereum L2 bridges go live, could serve as pathways for ecological credits to flow to where the buyers actually are. Noble's impending migration to an EVM L1 \u2014 Noble being the primary USDC issuance chain for Cosmos \u2014 does raise the question of how Regen will handle stablecoin settlement if the Cosmos-native USDC pathway changes. This is worth watching closely over the next six weeks.\n\n\n## Ecosystem Intelligence\n\nKOI's knowledge base has grown to **68,036 documents** \u2014 935 new in the last seven days \u2014 with the largest contributions from GitHub (37,411 documents), Notion (6,578), and podcast transcripts (6,063). The knowledge graph maps Regen Network across 7,744 occurrences and 2,903 relationships, with the Ecocredit Module (1,941 occurrences) and Cosmos SDK (1,613) as the most densely connected technical entities.\n\nThis week has been quiet on the community activity front. The KOI weekly digest reports zero new community forum posts and zero new credit batches for the February 1\u20138 period. The chain is in maintenance mode as it prepares for the v7 upgrade.\n\nThe most interesting forum threads remain the ones identified in previous digests:\n\n- **$REGEN Tokenomics WG** \u2014 68 replies, 353 views, last active February 3. The fixed cap, dynamic supply model is the most ambitious economic redesign under discussion in any ecological credit blockchain. Agent-based modeling work is underway.\n- **Framework Working Group: Progress & Why It Matters** \u2014 The work to formalize Regen's credit approval and methodology frameworks continues. This is infrastructure work that doesn't make headlines but determines whether new credit types can be onboarded efficiently.\n- **LST for Regen Network** \u2014 Liquid staking discussions from October 2025. If implemented, this would allow REGEN stakers to maintain governance participation while deploying their staked assets in DeFi \u2014 a quality-of-life improvement that could deepen governance engagement.\n- **Calling Giants: A Perpetual Berkshire-Grade Strategy for Regen** \u2014 A provocative proposal from late 2025 about building a permanent capital vehicle for Regen. The ambition-to-execution gap is wide, but the strategic thinking is sound.\n\nThe **Regen Builder Lab** (formerly Ecocredit Builder Lab) continues to signal Regen's broadening scope beyond ecocredits into general-purpose regenerative tooling. The name change itself is significant: it signals that Regen sees its future as a platform, not just a registry.\n\n\n## Current Events\n\nThe external landscape continues to develop rapidly around Regen's positioning.\n\n**Carbon market bifurcation deepens.** The Astute Analytica report projects the global carbon credit market reaching $4.98 billion by 2035 at 18% CAGR, but the more telling statistic is the price spread: commodity renewable energy credits trade at $1\u20132 per ton while premium nature-based credits exceed $12 per ton. This six-to-twelve-fold premium for quality credits is exactly the market segment Regen's registry serves. The COP30 Open Coalition on Compliance Carbon Markets, launched at Belem, is pushing for cross-border standards that would further advantage registries with transparent, verifiable methodologies \u2014 which is Regen's core value proposition.\n\n**Biodiversity credits gain institutional backing.** The Biodiversity Credit Alliance's 2025\u20132026 Strategic Plan focuses on science-based principles and meaningful participation for Indigenous communities \u2014 language that mirrors Regen's own biocultural crediting pilot in the Amazon. UNEP's State of Finance for Nature 2026 report warns that nature-based solutions investment must increase 2.5x to $571 billion annually by 2030 to meet global targets. The gap between what's needed and what's flowing creates both urgency and opportunity for platforms that can channel capital to verified ecological outcomes.\n\n**ReFi infrastructure matures.** The tokenized carbon credit ecosystem is consolidating around programmable, tradeable assets. EcoSync and CarbonCore are partnering to bridge traditional and DeFi carbon markets by Q2 2026. KlimaDAO reports all-time highs in credit settlement and retirement volumes. The thesis that blockchain-verified ecological credits will become a standard financial primitive \u2014 which Regen pioneered \u2014 is increasingly mainstream.\n\n**Cosmos fractures and rebuilds simultaneously.** The exodus is accelerating. Sei Network's Version 6.4 update, scheduled for this month, will disable inbound IBC transfers as Sei completes its exit to become an EVM-only chain. Noble \u2014 the USDC issuance chain for Cosmos \u2014 has announced its own migration to an EVM L1, launching March 18. Holders must convert Cosmos-native assets before late March or risk losing access. These are not peripheral projects; Noble handles the stablecoin infrastructure that much of Cosmos depends on. Yet the Cosmos Labs roadmap for Q1 2026 includes IBC Eureka bridges to Solana, Base, and other Ethereum L2s \u2014 potentially connecting the remaining Cosmos ecosystem to vastly larger liquidity pools. The ATOM token itself rose 2% on February 4 while most crypto fell, suggesting the market is beginning to price in the survivor premium for chains that stay.\n\n**USDA regenerative program operationalizes, and food brands follow.** The $700 million Regenerative Pilot Program ($400M EQIP + $300M CSP) is now accepting applications through local NRCS Service Centers. The program focuses on whole-farm planning that addresses soil, water, and natural vitality under a single framework. Critics note USDA lacks the specialist workforce to implement the program at scale, but the signal extends beyond policy: King Arthur Baking Co. committed this week to sourcing 100% of its flour from regeneratively grown wheat by 2030, alongside Cairnspring Mills and Simple Mills demonstrating that regenerative sourcing works as a business model, not just a sustainability claim. Environmental credits are explicitly identified as farmer revenue tools in the USDA program \u2014 a direct validation of the credit-as-incentive model that Regen's registry operationalizes.\n\n**Climate finance commitments waver.** Reports emerged today that the UK may be reconsidering its pledge to triple climate financing for poorer countries \u2014 a cornerstone of the COP30 $1.3 trillion pathway agreed at Belem. If confirmed, this would be the first major defection from the COP30 framework and raises questions about whether the ambitious financing targets that create demand for ecological credits will actually materialize. Moody's projects $530 billion in green bonds and $190 billion in sustainability bonds for 2026, but these projections assume political commitments hold.\n\n**Bioregionalism stirs.** For the first time in over fifteen years, bioregionalists across North America are organizing a Continental Bioregional Congress \u2014 a gathering of organizers, artists, land stewards, and community leaders from the US, Canada, and Mexico. The timing is not coincidental. As the climate crisis deepens, the bioregional framework that Regen Network embodies \u2014 organizing economic and ecological activity around watersheds and ecosystems rather than political boundaries \u2014 is experiencing a genuine intellectual revival. A recent piece on Resilience.org explores how finance can be conjoined with a bioregion's watersheds, forests, and arable land, articulating the theoretical basis for exactly the kind of place-based ecological crediting that Regen's registry enables.\n\n\n## Reflection\n\nThree days since the last digest, and the picture has sharpened. The v7 upgrade is no longer a question \u2014 it passed, and the chain will upgrade Monday. What was uncertain on February 4 is now settled.\n\nWhat has not changed is the fundamental tension in Regen's position. The registry is sophisticated: 13 credit classes, 78 batches, 58 projects, five credit types spanning carbon, biodiversity, marine stewardship, umbrella species, and grazing credits. The geographic reach is global. The partnerships are real \u2014 Terrasos in Colombia, Sharamentsa Achuar in Ecuador, Pantanal Conservation Network in Brazil, Ecometric in England. The technology stack, about to receive its seventh major upgrade, is robust.\n\nBut the marketplace is quiet. Zero buy orders. Zero trading volume over 30 days. The sell orders endpoint itself is returning errors. The supply side has been built; the demand side has not arrived.\n\nThe external market is beginning to close this gap. Premium nature-based credits command 6\u201312x the price of commodity offsets. The COP30 coalition is pushing cross-border compliance standards. UNEP says nature finance must increase 2.5x by 2030. The USDA is directing $700 million toward regenerative practices with environmental credits as explicit farmer revenue. The capital is there, and it increasingly wants exactly what Regen offers.\n\nThe question has evolved since February 4. It is no longer \"will the trains start running?\" \u2014 it is \"which station will they depart from?\" If IBC Eureka successfully bridges to Ethereum and Solana this quarter, Regen's credits become accessible to a buyer pool orders of magnitude larger than the Cosmos ecosystem alone. If the tokenomics redesign creates structural demand pressure through credit-backed token value, the marketplace liquidity problem solves itself. If neither happens quickly enough, the window of opportunity may narrow as centralized registries and competing blockchain platforms capture the same market Regen pioneered.\n\nBut February 7 adds a new wrinkle that February 4 did not have: Noble's migration to an EVM L1 on March 18. Noble is not just another chain leaving Cosmos \u2014 it is the USDC issuance infrastructure that the remaining Cosmos ecosystem depends on for stablecoin settlement. If Regen's marketplace ever does come alive, the buyers will need to pay in stablecoins. The March 18 date deserves close attention.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK's potential retreat from COP30 climate financing commitments is a reminder that the political tailwinds behind ecological credit markets are not guaranteed. The capital exists, the market structures are forming, but the policy architecture that channels institutional money into nature-based solutions remains fragile. Regen's technology is ready. The question is whether the world around it will hold together long enough for the match to be made.\n\nThe v7 upgrade lands Monday. The tokenomics working group is modeling the future. The first Continental Bioregional Congress in fifteen years is being planned. The next ninety days will tell us whether these threads converge \u2014 or whether they remain, as they have been for too long, parallel lines that never quite meet.\n\n---\n\n*Generated by Regen Heartbeat on February 7, 2026.

The upgrade introduces Cosmos SDK upgrade, circuit breaker module, protocolpool module, and governance-gated wasm contract upload.\n\n2. **No proposals are currently in voting period or deposit period.** The chain is in a governance quiet period.\n\n3. **LiquidityDAO is the dominant governance theme** -- proposals #54, #55, #58, #60, and #61 are all LiquidityDAO emissions transfers, disbursing a total of 1,785,600 REGEN from the community pool over the Aug 2025 - Jan 2026 period.\n\n4. **Community pool holds ~3.41M REGEN**, which represents about 1.5% of the total 225M REGEN supply.\n\n5. **Total REGEN supply is ~225.07M REGEN** across 36 denominations on-chain (including IBC tokens and the NCT basket token).</result>\n<usage>total_tokens: 55752\ntool_uses: 36\nduration_ms: 1537868</usage>\n</task-notification>\nFull transcript available at: /tmp/claude-1000/-home-ygg-Workspace-regenai-regen-heartbeat/tasks/a8d81f9.output"}}

This could indicate the marketplace endpoint on the Regen chain is currently experiencing issues, or there are no active sell orders and the endpoint returns a 500 in that case.\n\n---\n\n## QUERY 5: analyze_market_trends\n\n**Time period: 30 days**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"analysis_period\": {\n    \"time_period\": \"30d\",\n    \"period_days\": 30,\n    \"analysis_date\": \"2026-02-08T04:43:19.675651\"\n  },\n  \"current_market_snapshot\": {\n    \"by_credit_type\": {},\n    \"overall_metrics\": {\n      \"total_orders\": 0,\n      \"total_volume\": 0,\n      \"total_value\": 0,\n      \"active_credit_types\": [],\n      \"unique_batches\": 0,\n      \"price_distribution\": []\n    }\n  },\n  \"trend_analysis\": {\n    \"time_period\": \"30d\",\n    \"period_days\": 30,\n    \"trend_direction\": {},\n    \"volatility_analysis\": {},\n    \"volume_trends\": {},\n    \"market_sentiment\": {}\n  },\n  \"projections_and_insights\": {\n    \"short_term\": \"Based on current 30d trends, market shows stable activity with moderate liquidity.\",\n    \"medium_term\": \"Credit diversification suggests healthy market development potential.\",\n    \"risk_factors\": [\n      \"Limited credit type diversity may impact market resilience\",\n      \"Low order count indicates limited market liquidity\"\n    ],\n    \"opportunities\": []\n  },\n  \"methodology\": {\n    \"data_sources\": [\"current_sell_orders\", \"credit_classes\", \"credit_batches\"],\n    \"analysis_type\": \"cross_sectional_with_simulated_trends\",\n    \"limitations\": \"Historical data simulation - real trends would require time-series data\"\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"generated_at\": \"2026-02-08T04:43:19.675665\",\n    \"credit_types_analyzed\": [],\n    \"orders_analyzed\": 0,\n    \"analysis_version\": \"1.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe market trends analysis shows zero active orders, zero volume, and zero value across all credit types for the 30-day period. This is consistent with the sell orders query failing -- the marketplace module appears to have no active orders or the endpoint is down.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of All Queries\n\n| Query | Tool | Result | Record Count |\n|-------|------|--------|-------------|\n| 1 | `list_credit_batches` | Success | 78 batches total |\n| 2 | `list_classes` | Success | 13 credit classes |\n| 3 | `list_projects` | Success | 58 registered projects |\n| 4 | `list_sell_orders` | Failed (HTTP 500) | 0 orders |\n| 5 | `analyze_market_trends` | Success (empty market) | 0 orders analyzed |\n\n**Notable observations for digest generation:**\n- The **most recent batch issuance** was on **2026-01-16** (C08-001, project in US-WI), just 22 days ago.\n- **C06** (carbon credits, GB-ENG jurisdiction) has the largest cluster of recent issuances, with a burst of 10+ batches issued on 2025-10-01 and continuing through November 2025.\n- The marketplace module returned a server error on sell orders, and the market trends analysis consequently shows zero activity. This is worth noting in the digest as either a chain endpoint issue or a genuine period of marketplace inactivity.\n- All data was retrieved by directly initializing the `regen-python-mcp` MCP server (version 1.26.0) via the `uvx` package manager and communicating over JSON-RPC stdio transport.</result>\n<usage>total_tokens: 107737\ntool_uses: 50\nduration_ms: 2514004</usage>\n</task-notification>\nFull transcript available at: /tmp/claude-1000/-home-ygg-Workspace-regenai-regen-heartbeat/tasks/a888bf7.output"}}
