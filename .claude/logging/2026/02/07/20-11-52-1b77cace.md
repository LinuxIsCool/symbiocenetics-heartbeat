> I don't have direct access to invoke MCP tools from within this session in the way you're asking. The KOI MCP tools are available as MCP server tools that Claude Code calls natively during conversation — they aren't invoked through bash commands.
> 
> Let me try calling the search tool directly as an MCP tool.
> 
> `★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
> MCP tools in Claude Code are exposed as native tools — they appear alongside built-in tools like Read, Write, and Bash. The KOI MCP `search` tool should be callable directly if the MCP server is running and connected. The plugin `koi@regen-ai` is enabled in `.claude/settings.json`, which means its tools should be available in this session.
> `─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
> 
> Unfortunately, I don't see the KOI MCP `search` tool in my available tool list for this session. The tools I have access to are: Task, Bash, Glob, Grep, Read, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, WebSearch, TodoWrite, AskUserQuestion, Skill, EnterPlanMode, ExitPlanMode, and TaskOutput/TaskStop.
> 
> This likely means one of:
> 
> 1. **The KOI MCP server isn't running** — The plugin is configured (`koi@regen-ai` in `.claude/settings.json`), but the MCP server may not be connected or started for this session
> 2. **The MCP tools aren't surfaced to me** — They may require a different invocation path
> 
> Let me check if there's a way to verify the MCP connection status.
