> I don't have permission to run the `claude` CLI as a subprocess. Unfortunately, I don't have direct access to MCP tools from my current environment — MCP tools like `list_credit_batches` from the Ledger plugin are available when invoked through skills/commands but aren't exposed as tools I can call directly in this conversation.
> 
> Here's what I can suggest:
> 
> **Option 1: Use the `/daily` skill** which internally calls the Ledger MCP tools as part of digest generation.
> 
> **Option 2: Run the query manually** by opening a separate Claude Code session and typing:
> 
> ```
> Call the Ledger MCP tool list_credit_batches with parameters: limit=100, reverse=true, count_total=true
> ```
> 
> **Option 3: Let me try invoking it through the daily skill infrastructure**, though that will wrap it in digest formatting.

> `★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
> MCP tools (like the Ledger and KOI plugins) are registered as external tool providers in Claude Code's plugin system. They're available to Claude during interactive sessions where the MCP servers are running, but subagents and nested CLI invocations may not inherit the MCP connection. The tools are designed to be called during skill/command execution (like `/daily`) where the full MCP context is established.
