The v7.2.0 upgrade is now locked in for block 25,516,877 \u2014 estimated Monday, February 10 at 15:00 UTC, three days from now. With 68.8 million REGEN voting Yes against a negligible 63 REGEN voting No, the chain has spoken with near-unanimity: the circuit breaker module, the protocol pool, and governance-gated CosmWasm uploads are coming to Regen mainnet. Meanwhile, the broader ecosystem sits in a curious interstitial moment \u2014 the Cosmos world is both fragmenting (Sei abandoning IBC this month) and expanding (IBC Eureka bridging to Ethereum and Solana in Q1), carbon markets are bifurcating sharply between commodity offsets and premium nature-based credits, and Regen's own marketplace remains stubbornly quiet despite holding one of the most geographically diverse ecological credit registries on any blockchain.\n\n\n## Governance Pulse\n\nThe chain is in a governance quiet period. Proposal #62 cleared its voting window yesterday (February 6), passing with overwhelming consensus:\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Yes** | 68,790,406 REGEN |\n| **Abstain** | 12 REGEN |\n| **No** | 63 REGEN |\n| **No with Veto** | 0 |\n\nThis represents roughly 30% of total supply participating \u2014 consistent with the governance participation range of 22\u201335% observed across the last ten proposals. Zero veto votes signals that the community considers v7.2.0 an uncontroversial technical improvement rather than a political question.\n\nThe upgrade itself brings three significant capabilities to mainnet. The **circuit breaker module** allows designated authorities to pause specific message types during emergencies \u2014 a safety mechanism that became standard practice across Cosmos chains after several exploit incidents in 2024\u20132025. The **protocol pool module** creates a new on-chain funding mechanism separate from the existing community pool. And **governance-gated CosmWasm uploads** enable smart contract deployment on Regen, but only through governance approval \u2014 a deliberate choice to prevent the spam contract deployments that plagued other Cosmos chains.\n\nLooking at governance spending patterns, the LiquidityDAO continues to be the primary recipient of community pool funds. Five of the last ten proposals (#54, #55, #58, #60, #61) were LiquidityDAO emissions transfers, totaling 1,785,600 REGEN disbursed between August 2025 and January 2026. Combined with the Tokenomics Working Group's 500,000 REGEN grant and the X-Influencer Pilot's 129,810 REGEN, the community pool has committed approximately 2.4 million REGEN to operational expenditures over the past six months.\n\nThe **Tokenomics Working Group** discussion thread on the forum remains the most substantively active governance conversation, with 68 replies and 353 views as of February 3. The working group is pursuing agent-based modeling to simulate a fixed cap, dynamic supply model for REGEN \u2014 a direction the community endorsed in the Proposal #53 signalling vote last August. This is the thread to watch: if the tokenomics redesign succeeds, it would fundamentally reorient REGEN from an inflationary staking token to one whose value is structurally tied to ecological credit demand.\n\n\n## Ecocredit Activity\n\nThe Regen Registry holds steady at the numbers reported on February 4: **13 credit classes**, **58 projects**, and **78 credit batches** across five credit types. No new batches have been issued since C08-001 on January 16 \u2014 now 22 days without new issuance.\n\nThe geographic footprint remains impressive for a registry of this size. Fifty-eight projects span at least thirteen countries across six continents:\n\n| Region | Projects | Notable |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| England | 21 | C06 carbon credits \u2014 the largest single-country cluster |\n| United States | 14 | Spread across WA, OH, PA, VA, TN, IA, ID, TX, IL, WI, CA |\n| China | 4 | VCS-bridged via Toucan Protocol |\n| Brazil | 3 | Including USS01 umbrella species stewardship |\n| Colombia | 3 | Terrasos biodiversity credits (BT01) |\n| Kenya | 2 | C01 REDD+ and MBS01 marine biodiversity |\n| DR Congo | 2 | C01 and C03 carbon credits |\n| Others | 7 | Indonesia, Cambodia, Peru, Congo, Australia (2), Ecuador |\n\nThe C06 class \u2014 21 England-based carbon projects \u2014 saw the most active issuance period in late 2025, with 14 batches issued between September and November. This was the most concentrated batch of issuance activity in Regen's history and suggests a significant crediting pipeline in the UK that could produce further batches in 2026.\n\nThe marketplace remains effectively dormant. The sell orders endpoint returned HTTP 500 errors today, and the 30-day market trend analysis shows zero active orders, zero volume, and zero trading value. The marketplace infrastructure exists \u2014 23 sell orders were visible as recently as February 4 \u2014 but the buy side has not materialized. This supply-demand imbalance remains the most persistent challenge in Regen's operational profile.\n\n\n## Chain Health\n\n| Metric | Value | Change from Feb 4 |\n|--------|-------|-------------------|\n| **Total REGEN Supply** | 225,068,767 REGEN | +248,977 |\n| **Community Pool** | 3,410,414 REGEN (~3.41M) | +42,350 |\n| **Active Validators** | 21 | -- |\n| **REGEN Bonded** | 106.9M | -- |\n| **IBC Channels** | 100 | -- |\n\nSupply increased by approximately 249,000 REGEN over three days, consistent with normal block reward emissions. The community pool grew by 42,350 REGEN \u2014 a healthy accumulation rate that will fund future governance proposals. At 3.41 million REGEN (1.51% of total supply), the pool represents a meaningful but not excessive reserve.\n\nThe validator set at 21 active validators is small but stable. With 106.9 million REGEN bonded (approximately 47% of total supply), the chain maintains a healthy staking ratio that secures the network while leaving sufficient liquid supply for transactions and governance participation.\n\nThe REGEN token trades at approximately $0.0038, with a live market cap around $559,000 \u2014 a figure that reflects the token's current status as a governance and staking asset rather than a value-accrual mechanism. Trading volume saw a 113% spike in the last 24 hours, though the price declined 16% over the past seven days. These microcap dynamics are noise; the structural question remains whether the Tokenomics Working Group's redesign can create a durable link between credit sales and token value.\n\nThe 100 active IBC channels position Regen well for the cross-chain expansion that IBC Eureka promises. These channels connect Regen to the broader Cosmos ecosystem and, once the Solana and Ethereum L2 bridges go live, could serve as pathways for ecological credits to flow to where the buyers actually are. Noble's impending migration to an EVM L1 \u2014 Noble being the primary USDC issuance chain for Cosmos \u2014 does raise the question of how Regen will handle stablecoin settlement if the Cosmos-native USDC pathway changes. This is worth watching closely over the next six weeks.\n\n\n## Ecosystem Intelligence\n\nKOI's knowledge base has grown to **68,036 documents** \u2014 935 new in the last seven days \u2014 with the largest contributions from GitHub (37,411 documents), Notion (6,578), and podcast transcripts (6,063). The knowledge graph maps Regen Network across 7,744 occurrences and 2,903 relationships, with the Ecocredit Module (1,941 occurrences) and Cosmos SDK (1,613) as the most densely connected technical entities.\n\nThis week has been quiet on the community activity front. The KOI weekly digest reports zero new community forum posts and zero new credit batches for the February 1\u20138 period. The chain is in maintenance mode as it prepares for the v7 upgrade.\n\nThe most interesting forum threads remain the ones identified in previous digests:\n\n- **$REGEN Tokenomics WG** \u2014 68 replies, 353 views, last active February 3. The fixed cap, dynamic supply model is the most ambitious economic redesign under discussion in any ecological credit blockchain. Agent-based modeling work is underway.\n- **Framework Working Group: Progress & Why It Matters** \u2014 The work to formalize Regen's credit approval and methodology frameworks continues. This is infrastructure work that doesn't make headlines but determines whether new credit types can be onboarded efficiently.\n- **LST for Regen Network** \u2014 Liquid staking discussions from October 2025. If implemented, this would allow REGEN stakers to maintain governance participation while deploying their staked assets in DeFi \u2014 a quality-of-life improvement that could deepen governance engagement.\n- **Calling Giants: A Perpetual Berkshire-Grade Strategy for Regen** \u2014 A provocative proposal from late 2025 about building a permanent capital vehicle for Regen. The ambition-to-execution gap is wide, but the strategic thinking is sound.\n\nThe **Regen Builder Lab** (formerly Ecocredit Builder Lab) continues to signal Regen's broadening scope beyond ecocredits into general-purpose regenerative tooling. The name change itself is significant: it signals that Regen sees its future as a platform, not just a registry.\n\n\n## Current Events\n\nThe external landscape continues to develop rapidly around Regen's positioning.\n\n**Carbon market bifurcation deepens.** The Astute Analytica report projects the global carbon credit market reaching $4.98 billion by 2035 at 18% CAGR, but the more telling statistic is the price spread: commodity renewable energy credits trade at $1\u20132 per ton while premium nature-based credits exceed $12 per ton. This six-to-twelve-fold premium for quality credits is exactly the market segment Regen's registry serves. The COP30 Open Coalition on Compliance Carbon Markets, launched at Belem, is pushing for cross-border standards that would further advantage registries with transparent, verifiable methodologies \u2014 which is Regen's core value proposition.\n\n**Biodiversity credits gain institutional backing.** The Biodiversity Credit Alliance's 2025\u20132026 Strategic Plan focuses on science-based principles and meaningful participation for Indigenous communities \u2014 language that mirrors Regen's own biocultural crediting pilot in the Amazon. UNEP's State of Finance for Nature 2026 report warns that nature-based solutions investment must increase 2.5x to $571 billion annually by 2030 to meet global targets. The gap between what's needed and what's flowing creates both urgency and opportunity for platforms that can channel capital to verified ecological outcomes.\n\n**ReFi infrastructure matures.** The tokenized carbon credit ecosystem is consolidating around programmable, tradeable assets. EcoSync and CarbonCore are partnering to bridge traditional and DeFi carbon markets by Q2 2026. KlimaDAO reports all-time highs in credit settlement and retirement volumes. The thesis that blockchain-verified ecological credits will become a standard financial primitive \u2014 which Regen pioneered \u2014 is increasingly mainstream.\n\n**Cosmos fractures and rebuilds simultaneously.** The exodus is accelerating. Sei Network's Version 6.4 update, scheduled for this month, will disable inbound IBC transfers as Sei completes its exit to become an EVM-only chain. Noble \u2014 the USDC issuance chain for Cosmos \u2014 has announced its own migration to an EVM L1, launching March 18. Holders must convert Cosmos-native assets before late March or risk losing access. These are not peripheral projects; Noble handles the stablecoin infrastructure that much of Cosmos depends on. Yet the Cosmos Labs roadmap for Q1 2026 includes IBC Eureka bridges to Solana, Base, and other Ethereum L2s \u2014 potentially connecting the remaining Cosmos ecosystem to vastly larger liquidity pools. The ATOM token itself rose 2% on February 4 while most crypto fell, suggesting the market is beginning to price in the survivor premium for chains that stay.\n\n**USDA regenerative program operationalizes, and food brands follow.** The $700 million Regenerative Pilot Program ($400M EQIP + $300M CSP) is now accepting applications through local NRCS Service Centers. The program focuses on whole-farm planning that addresses soil, water, and natural vitality under a single framework. Critics note USDA lacks the specialist workforce to implement the program at scale, but the signal extends beyond policy: King Arthur Baking Co. committed this week to sourcing 100% of its flour from regeneratively grown wheat by 2030, alongside Cairnspring Mills and Simple Mills demonstrating that regenerative sourcing works as a business model, not just a sustainability claim. Environmental credits are explicitly identified as farmer revenue tools in the USDA program \u2014 a direct validation of the credit-as-incentive model that Regen's registry operationalizes.\n\n**Climate finance commitments waver.** Reports emerged today that the UK may be reconsidering its pledge to triple climate financing for poorer countries \u2014 a cornerstone of the COP30 $1.3 trillion pathway agreed at Belem. If confirmed, this would be the first major defection from the COP30 framework and raises questions about whether the ambitious financing targets that create demand for ecological credits will actually materialize. Moody's projects $530 billion in green bonds and $190 billion in sustainability bonds for 2026, but these projections assume political commitments hold.\n\n**Bioregionalism stirs.** For the first time in over fifteen years, bioregionalists across North America are organizing a Continental Bioregional Congress \u2014 a gathering of organizers, artists, land stewards, and community leaders from the US, Canada, and Mexico. The timing is not coincidental. As the climate crisis deepens, the bioregional framework that Regen Network embodies \u2014 organizing economic and ecological activity around watersheds and ecosystems rather than political boundaries \u2014 is experiencing a genuine intellectual revival. A recent piece on Resilience.org explores how finance can be conjoined with a bioregion's watersheds, forests, and arable land, articulating the theoretical basis for exactly the kind of place-based ecological crediting that Regen's registry enables.\n\n\n## Reflection\n\nThree days since the last digest, and the picture has sharpened. The v7 upgrade is no longer a question \u2014 it passed, and the chain will upgrade Monday. What was uncertain on February 4 is now settled.\n\nWhat has not changed is the fundamental tension in Regen's position. The registry is sophisticated: 13 credit classes, 78 batches, 58 projects, five credit types spanning carbon, biodiversity, marine stewardship, umbrella species, and grazing credits. The geographic reach is global. The partnerships are real \u2014 Terrasos in Colombia, Sharamentsa Achuar in Ecuador, Pantanal Conservation Network in Brazil, Ecometric in England. The technology stack, about to receive its seventh major upgrade, is robust.\n\nBut the marketplace is quiet. Zero buy orders. Zero trading volume over 30 days. The sell orders endpoint itself is returning errors. The supply side has been built; the demand side has not arrived.\n\nThe external market is beginning to close this gap. Premium nature-based credits command 6\u201312x the price of commodity offsets. The COP30 coalition is pushing cross-border compliance standards. UNEP says nature finance must increase 2.5x by 2030. The USDA is directing $700 million toward regenerative practices with environmental credits as explicit farmer revenue. The capital is there, and it increasingly wants exactly what Regen offers.\n\nThe question has evolved since February 4. It is no longer \"will the trains start running?\" \u2014 it is \"which station will they depart from?\" If IBC Eureka successfully bridges to Ethereum and Solana this quarter, Regen's credits become accessible to a buyer pool orders of magnitude larger than the Cosmos ecosystem alone. If the tokenomics redesign creates structural demand pressure through credit-backed token value, the marketplace liquidity problem solves itself. If neither happens quickly enough, the window of opportunity may narrow as centralized registries and competing blockchain platforms capture the same market Regen pioneered.\n\nBut February 7 adds a new wrinkle that February 4 did not have: Noble's migration to an EVM L1 on March 18. Noble is not just another chain leaving Cosmos \u2014 it is the USDC issuance infrastructure that the remaining Cosmos ecosystem depends on for stablecoin settlement. If Regen's marketplace ever does come alive, the buyers will need to pay in stablecoins. The March 18 date deserves close attention.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK's potential retreat from COP30 climate financing commitments is a reminder that the political tailwinds behind ecological credit markets are not guaranteed. The capital exists, the market structures are forming, but the policy architecture that channels institutional money into nature-based solutions remains fragile. Regen's technology is ready. The question is whether the world around it will hold together long enough for the match to be made.\n\nThe v7 upgrade lands Monday. The tokenomics working group is modeling the future. The first Continental Bioregional Congress in fifteen years is being planned. The next ninety days will tell us whether these threads converge \u2014 or whether they remain, as they have been for too long, parallel lines that never quite meet.\n\n---\n\n*Generated by Regen Heartbeat on February 7, 2026.

The global carbon credit market is experiencing explosive growth, driven by robust corporate demand, net-zero targets, and tightening regulations.\n\n## Integration of Biodiversity Co-Benefits\n\nThe carbon credit market is moving beyond simply pricing carbon emissions to explicitly recognizing and monetizing verified co-benefits, with the market increasingly rewarding projects that demonstrate tangible positive impacts on biodiversity, community welfare, and ecosystem health. Carbon credits carrying biodiversity certifications, such as the Climate, Community & Biodiversity (CCB) Standards, command an average price premium of over $2.50 per credit.\n\n## Biodiversity Credit Market Development\n\nThe Biodiversity Credit Alliance released its 2025\u20132026 Strategic Plan, charting a path to build a transparent, trustworthy, and high-integrity global biodiversity credit market, with focus on setting science-based principles, strengthening market governance, and ensuring meaningful participation and benefits for Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Well-designed biodiversity credit schemes represent an opportunity to invest in nature and could unlock significant private finance for conservation, with 80% of conservation funding currently coming from public sources and an estimated $598\u2013824 billion gap to reach Global Biodiversity Framework targets.\n\n## EU Market Developments\n\nThe EU market for nature credits will align with at least four marine protection policies, while helping bridge the funding gap left by carbon markets."], "durationSeconds": 27.83716503599999}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01Xkb3AUouuZcsxpQwPBWctw"}}

These tools span search capabilities, code graph queries, entity resolution, repository exploration, metadata operations, and system utilities.\n\nKOI indexes knowledge from twelve active sensors monitoring platforms including GitHub, GitLab, Discourse forums, Medium, Telegram, Discord, Twitter, podcasts, Notion, and the Regen blockchain itself. The system maintains 48,000+ documents, 26,768 code entities, and 614,000+ entity-chunk associations in a unified knowledge graph.\n\nThis reference documents each tool with its parameters, return format, usage examples, and role in digest generation workflows.\n\n---\n\n## Search & Discovery\n\n### search\n\nThe primary search tool for the Regen Network knowledge base. Uses the backend's Hybrid RAG system which automatically combines vector search (semantic similarity via BGE embeddings), entity search (entity-chunk links with 614K+ associations), and keyword search (lexical matching). Results are ranked using Weighted Average Fusion with entity boosting.\n\nThis is the most powerful and flexible search tool \u2014 it understands natural language queries, recognizes entity names, respects date filters, and automatically optimizes the search strategy based on query content.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |\n|-----------|------|---------|-------------|\n| `query` | string | **required** | Natural language search query (1-500 characters) |\n| `intent` | enum | `general` | Query intent for optimized retrieval: `general`, `person_activity`, `person_bio`, `technical_howto`, `concept_explain` |\n| `source` | string | \u2014 | Filter by data source (e.g., `notion`, `github`, `discourse`). Supports prefix matching. |\n| `sort_by` | enum | `relevance` | Sort order: `relevance`, `date_desc` (newest first), `date_asc` (oldest first) |\n| `limit` | number | 10 | Maximum results to return (1-50) |\n| `published_from` | string | \u2014 | Filter: published on/after this date (YYYY-MM-DD) |\n| `published_to` | string | \u2014 | Filter: published on/before this date (YYYY-MM-DD) |\n| `include_undated` | boolean | false | Include documents with no publication date when using date filters |\n\n**Intent Types:**\n\nThe `intent` parameter enables intent-aware retrieval for better results on specific query types:\n\n- **`general`**: Standard hybrid search (default)\n- **`person_activity`**: \"What is X working on?\" queries \u2014 triggers author search to find docs **authored by** the person\n- **`person_bio`**: \"Who is X?\" queries \u2014 prioritizes biographical content\n- **`technical_howto`**: \"How do I...?\" implementation questions \u2014 prioritizes code and technical docs\n- **`concept_explain`**: \"What is X?\" conceptual questions \u2014 prioritizes explanatory content\n\n**Return Shape:**\n\nReturns markdown-formatted results with document snippets, similarity scores, sources, and URLs. Each result includes the document title, content preview, publication date, and source platform.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nsearch(\n  query=\"governance proposal voting procedures\",\n  intent=\"technical_howto\",\n  source=\"github\",\n  limit=10\n)\n```\n\n**Digest Usage:**\n\nThe `search` tool is the workhorse of digest generation. Use it to:\n\n- Find recent activity by date range: `search(query=\"...\", published_from=\"2026-01-27\", published_to=\"2026-02-03\")`\n- Discover what people are working on: `search(query=\"Gregory Landua\", intent=\"person_activity\")`\n- Retrieve conceptual explanations: `search(query=\"credit retirement\", intent=\"concept_explain\")`\n- Filter to specific platforms: `search(query=\"governance\", source=\"discourse\")`\n\nFor weekly digests, combine date filtering with source filtering to segment activity by platform. For personalized summaries, use `intent=\"person_activity\"` to find contributions from specific people.\n\n---\n\n### search_github_docs\n\nSearch Regen Network GitHub repositories for documentation, README files, configuration files, and technical content. Searches `regen-ledger` (blockchain), `regen-web` (frontend), `regen-data-standards` (schemas), and `regenie-corpus` (documentation corpus).\n\nThis tool is specialized for code documentation and repository-level technical content. For semantic search across all knowledge sources, use the `search` tool instead.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |\n|-----------|------|---------|-------------|\n| `query` | string | **required** | Search query (1-300 characters) |\n| `repository` | enum | all repos | Filter by specific repo: `regen-ledger`, `regen-web`, `regen-data-standards`, `regenie-corpus` |\n| `limit` | number | 10 | Maximum results (1-20) |\n\n**Return Shape:**\n\nReturns markdown-formatted list of matching documents with file paths, repository names, and content previews.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nsearch_github_docs(\n  query=\"ecocredit module architecture\",\n  repository=\"regen-ledger\",\n  limit=5\n)\n```\n\n**Digest Usage:**\n\nUse this tool when generating digests that focus on code changes, technical documentation updates, or repository-specific activity. Ideal for developer-focused digests where you need to highlight changes to specs, README files, or architectural documentation.\n\n---\n\n### generate_weekly_digest\n\nGenerate a markdown digest of Regen Network activity and discussions for a specified time period. This tool aggregates data from multiple sources including Discourse forum discussions, GitHub activity (commits, PRs, issues), on-chain governance proposals and votes, credit issuance/retirement metrics, and community channels.\n\nThe output is a curated markdown brief with executive summary, governance analysis, community discussions, and on-chain metrics. This is a condensed overview \u2014 use `get_notebooklm_export` for full content with complete forum posts and Notion pages.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |\n|-----------|------|---------|-------------|\n| `start_date` | string | 7 days ago | Start of date range (YYYY-MM-DD) |\n| `end_date` | string | today | End of date range (YYYY-MM-DD) |\n| `save_to_file` | boolean | false | Save to file on disk |\n| `output_path` | string | auto | Custom file path (if `save_to_file=true`). Defaults to `weekly_digest_YYYY-MM-DD.md` |\n| `format` | enum | `markdown` | Output format: `markdown` (human-readable report) or `json` (structured data) |\n\n**Return Shape:**\n\nReturns a markdown digest with sections for highlights, activity by module, governance updates, community discussions, and on-chain metrics. If `save_to_file=true`, also saves to disk and returns the file path.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\ngenerate_weekly_digest(\n  start_date=\"2026-01-27\",\n  end_date=\"2026-02-03\",\n  save_to_file=true,\n  output_path=\"/tmp/weekly.md\"\n)\n```\n\n**Digest Usage:**\n\nThis tool can serve as a template or starting point for custom digest generation. Examine its output structure to understand what sections are useful, then build your own digest workflows using the lower-level search tools for more control.\n\n---\n\n### get_notebooklm_export\n\nGet the full NotebookLM export with complete content including full forum thread posts, complete Notion page content (all chunks), enriched URLs, and detailed source material. Automatically saves to a local file to avoid bloating LLM context. Returns the file path and summary stats.\n\nThis is the comprehensive version of digest content \u2014 use this when you need the full text of everything, not summaries.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |\n|-----------|------|---------|-------------|\n| `output_path` | string | auto | Custom file path for saving. Defaults to `notebooklm_export_YYYY-MM-DD.md` |\n\n**Return Shape:**\n\nReturns the file path and summary statistics (total word count, document count, sources). The actual content is written to the file, not returned inline.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nget_notebooklm_export(output_path=\"/tmp/export.md\")\n```\n\n**Digest Usage:**\n\nUse this tool when you need to archive a full snapshot of the knowledge base for external processing (like NotebookLM for podcast generation), or when you want to perform deep analysis on complete documents rather than summaries.\n\n---\n\n### get_full_document\n\nRetrieve the complete content of a document by its RID (Resource Identifier) and save it to a local file. Useful for getting full text of documents found via search without bloating the LLM context window.\n\nSupports chunk RID resolution (automatically resolves chunk references to parent documents), privacy filtering (respects authentication), and chunk reassembly fallback (reconstructs documents from chunks if needed).\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |\n|-----------|------|---------|-------------|\n| `rid` | string | **required** | Document RID to retrieve (can be base doc or chunk RID) |\n| `output_path` | string | `document_<hash>.md` | Custom file path for saving |\n| `include_metadata_header` | boolean | true | Include YAML frontmatter with rid, title, url, source, published_at |\n\n**Return Shape:**\n\nReturns a summary with file path, file size, word count, source platform, and content source strategy (direct, chunks, or legacy_chunks). The document content is written to the file.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nget_full_document(\n  rid=\"orn:notion.page:regen/2f725b77-eda1-807d-a63e-c43e6145f7f1\",\n  output_path=\"/tmp/meeting-notes.md\",\n  include_metadata_header=true\n)\n```\n\n**Digest Usage:**\n\nUse this tool after running `search` to retrieve the complete text of high-value documents identified in search results. This is particularly useful for deep dives on specific topics or for including full source citations in premium digests.\n\n---\n\n## Graph & Entities\n\n### query_code_graph\n\nSearch the code knowledge graph with supported query types for exploring entities, relationships, modules, concepts, and call graphs. This tool queries the Apache AGE graph database directly, providing precise access to code structure and relationships.\n\nUse this for impact analysis, understanding code relationships, finding documentation for specific code entities, and tracing dependencies.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |\n|-----------|------|----------|-------------|\n| `query_type` | enum | **Yes** | Type of graph query to execute (see Query Types below) |\n| `entity_name` | string | Conditional | Name of entity to search for |\n| `entity_type` | string | Conditional | Type of entity (Function, Struct, Interface, Handler, Keeper, etc.) |\n| `doc_path` | string | No | Reserved (doc\u2192entity queries not currently supported via `/graph`) |\n| `repo_name` | string | No | Filter by repository name |\n| `module_name` | string | Conditional | Name of module/package |\n| `from_entity` | string | Conditional | Starting entity name for trace_call_chain |\n| `to_entity` | string | Conditional | Target entity name for trace_call_chain |\n| `limit` | number | 50 | Maximum number of results (1-200) |\n| `offset` | number | 0 | Number of results to skip for pagination |\n| `max_depth` | number | 4 | Maximum depth for call chain tracing (1-8) |\n\n**Query Types:**\n\n| query_type | Description | Required Params |\n|------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| `list_repos` | List all indexed repositories | None |\n| `find_by_type` | Find all entities of a specific type | `entity_type` |\n| `search_entities` | Search for entities by name | `entity_name` |\n| `keeper_for_msg` | Find keeper that handles a message | `entity_name` |\n| `msgs_for_keeper` | Find messages handled by keeper | `entity_name` |\n| `related_entities` | Find related entities | `entity_name` |\n| `list_entity_types` | List all entity types with counts | None |\n| `get_entity_stats` | Get comprehensive statistics | None |\n| `list_concepts` | List available high-level concepts | None |\n| `explain_concept` | Explain a concept | `entity_name` |\n| `find_concept_for_query` | Find relevant concepts for a query | `entity_name` |\n| `find_callers` | Find all functions that call this entity | `entity_name` |\n| `find_callees` | Find all functions called by this entity | `entity_name` |\n| `find_call_graph` | Get local call graph (callers + callees) | `entity_name` |\n| `list_modules` | List all modules in a repo | `repo_name` (optional) |\n| `get_module` | Get details for a specific module | `module_name` |\n| `search_modules` | Search modules by keyword | `entity_name` |\n| `module_entities` | Get entities in a module | `module_name` |\n| `module_for_entity` | Find module containing entity | `entity_name` |\n| `trace_call_chain` | Find path from from_entity to to_entity | `from_entity`, `to_entity` |\n| `find_orphaned_code` | Find code without callers | None |\n\n**Return Shape:**\n\nReturns markdown-formatted results with entity names, types, file paths, line numbers, signatures, and relationships.

Parse arguments:\n   - `--date YYYY-MM-DD` \u2014 generate for a specific date (defaults to today)\n   - `--template name` \u2014 use a specific template (defaults to the value in\n     `settings.json` at `defaults.template.daily`)\n   - `--character name` \u2014 voice the digest through a character persona\n2. Load the template from `templates/daily/{name}.md`\n3. Read the template's section structure and `<!-- source: -->` annotations\n4. For each section, query the appropriate data sources:\n\n   **Governance Pulse:**\n   - `ledger: list_governance_proposals` \u2014 active and recently closed proposals\n   - `ledger: list_governance_votes` \u2014 vote tallies on active proposals\n   - `ledger: get_governance_tally_result` \u2014 tally results for notable proposals\n   - `koi: search(query=\"governance proposal\")` \u2014 forum discussions about governance\n\n   **Ecocredit Activity:**\n   - `ledger: list_credit_batches` \u2014 recent batch issuances\n   - `ledger: list_classes` \u2014 credit class overview\n   - `ledger: list_projects` \u2014 registered projects\n   - `ledger: list_sell_orders` \u2014 marketplace activity\n   - `ledger: analyze_market_trends` \u2014 credit market trends\n   - `koi: search(query=\"ecocredit registry\")` \u2014 related discussions\n\n   **Chain Health:**\n   - `ledger: get_total_supply` \u2014 token supply metrics\n   - `ledger: get_community_pool` \u2014 community pool balance\n\n   **Ecosystem Intelligence:**\n   - `koi: generate_weekly_digest` \u2014 curated summary of recent activity\n   - `koi: search` \u2014 topic-specific searches for notable developments\n   - `koi: get_entity_neighborhood` \u2014 relationship mapping for key entities\n\n   **Current Events:**\n   - Web search using topics from `settings.json`\n\n   **Reflection:**\n   - Read previous daily digests from `content/digests/` for comparison\n   - Identify trends, changes, and open questions\n\n5. Synthesize findings into a coherent digest following the template structure\n6. If `--character` is specified, load the character skill and voice the digest\n7. Write YAML frontmatter:\n\n   ```yaml\n   ---\n   title: \"Daily Heartbeat \u2014 {date}\"\n   date: {YYYY-MM-DD}\n   template: {template-name}\n   character: {character-name or null}\n   cadence: daily\n   sources:\n     koi: true\n     ledger: true\n     web: true\n     historic: {true if previous digests exist}\n   ---\n   ```\n\n8. Write to `content/digests/YYYY/MM/DD/daily.md` (create directories as needed)\n9. Also render the full digest to the terminal\n\n## Example Invocations\n\n```\n/daily\n/daily --date 2026-02-02\n/daily --character narrator\n/daily --template default --character governor\n```\n\n## Data Sources\n\n- **KOI MCP** \u2014 knowledge base search, weekly digests, entity relationships\n- **Ledger MCP** \u2014 on-chain governance, ecocredits, supply, marketplace\n- **WebSearch** \u2014 current events from `settings.json` topics\n- **Historic digests** \u2014 previous files in `content/digests/`\n- **Template** \u2014 section structure from `templates/daily/`\n\n## Output\n\nA markdown file at `content/digests/YYYY/MM/DD/daily.md` with frontmatter, plus\nterminal output of the same content.\n", "numLines": 93, "startLine": 1, "totalLines": 93}}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01VqBpxwGDyCwSoeDyQC9pmP"}}

The network maintained 21 validators and 100 active IBC channels, indicating stable governance and cross-chain connectivity despite the absence of new discussions or proposals.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Regen Network Weekly Brief\\n\\n## Opening Overview\\nThis week in the Regen Network ecosystem saw 0 credit batches and 0 new credits issued, highlighting a period of inactivity in terms of credit generation and issuance. However, the ecosystem recorded 1 completed governance proposal, showcasing ongoing administrative processes. The marketplace was active with 23 sell orders, yet there were no buy orders noted, pointing to a potential imbalance between supply and demand. The network maintained a healthy infrastructure with 21 validators ensuring network security and functionality. Additionally, 100 IBC channels remained active, indicating robust cross-chain connectivity, which is essential for the ecosystem's growth and interoperability.\\n\\n## Governance Deep Dive\\nIn the past week, the Regen Network saw 1 completed proposal, providing insights into governance dynamics. While the specific details of this proposal are not outlined, its completion suggests that the governance mechanisms within the ecosystem are functioning, even in a week of low activity. The existence of 21 validators indicates a strong community backing for governance processes, as validator participation is crucial for voting and proposal support. The lack of active proposals may reflect a temporary pause in governance activity, but the completed proposal signifies that the community is still engaged in shaping the network. The governance structure is vital for maintaining ecosystem integrity, responding to community needs, and adapting to changing landscapes in regenerative finance. Continued participation from validators is essential to ensure that governance remains responsive and inclusive, promoting a healthy balance of power within the ecosystem.\\n\\n## Community Forum Analysis\\nThis week, there were no unique discussions within the community forums, which may indicate a lull in active engagement or a reflection of current priorities among community members. The absence of forum activity can have several implications; it may point to a period of reflection or a need for revitalization of discussions around key topics affecting the ecosystem. Engaging community members is critical to fostering collaboration and innovation, particularly in a space focused on regenerative finance. The lack of discussions might also suggest that the community is awaiting further developments or proposals to stimulate conversation. For the Regen Network to align with broader trends in regenerative finance, active engagement is vital, as it fosters the sharing of ideas and strategies that can lead to more robust ecosystem growth. The community's ability to adapt and respond to changing needs will be essential in the coming weeks.\\n\\n## Marketplace and Network Metrics\\nThe marketplace exhibited 23 sell orders, but notably, there were no buy orders recorded, which could indicate a potential mismatch in market dynamics. This scenario underscores the necessity for strategic marketing or community engagement efforts to encourage purchasing activity, driving demand for the ecosystem's credits. Without active buy orders, the liquidity of the marketplace may be compromised, which could hinder the overall economic activity within the network. Additionally, the presence of 100 active IBC channels suggests that the Regen Network is well-positioned for cross-chain transactions, which can enhance market connectivity and accessibility. This strong IBC framework can facilitate transactions and interactions with other blockchain networks, promoting a healthier marketplace in the long run. The ecosystem's ability to leverage these active channels could be crucial in addressing the current marketplace imbalance by attracting new users and investors.\\n\\n## Technical Developments\\nThe ledger data indicates that there were no significant technical developments or changes introduced during the past week. With only one completed proposal and no new proposals, it appears that the focus may have shifted away from technical enhancements for the time being. The infrastructure remains stable with 21 validators supporting the network, ensuring security and operational efficiency. However, the lack of new technical initiatives may indicate a pause in development, which could have implications for future advancements and innovations within the ecosystem. Continuous technical improvements are essential for maintaining competitive edge and ensuring that the network can meet the evolving needs of its users. Stakeholders will need to consider future proposals that could reinvigorate technical progress and development momentum.\\n\\n## Synthesis and Outlook\\nIn summary, the Regen Network experienced a week characterized by governance stability, indicated by the completion of 1 proposal, but overall community engagement was minimal with no discussions or new proposals. Marketplace dynamics reveal a concerning trend with 23 sell orders and no buy orders, suggesting a need for renewed marketing efforts or community engagement initiatives. The robust infrastructure with 21 validators and 100 active IBC channels remains a positive aspect, providing a solid foundation for future growth. Moving forward, the ecosystem may face challenges in revitalizing community discussions and encouraging marketplace activity.

Here are the key findings:\n\n## What is Mutual Credit?\n\nMutual credit is a class of exchange systems in which participants extend credit to one another for the provision of goods and services. Instead of relying on an issued, circulating currency, mutual credit systems use accounting entries to record contributions and receipts.\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\nMutual credit systems generally share the following characteristics: Endogenous credit creation (units of account are created automatically when transactions occur), absence of interest (balances do not accrue interest), and credit limits (maximum debit limits are set to manage risk and support reciprocity).\n\n## Applications\n\nMutual credit is used in complementary currency schemes, local exchange trading systems, time banks, community exchange networks, and some business-to-business (B2B) barter exchanges.\n\n## Current State and Growth\n\nResponses to the economic crisis of 2007-2008, and ambitions to create autonomous systems of exchange generated hundreds of complementary currencies in the past decade. Created to connect local actors, help local businesses or assure financial transparency, mutual credit systems, convertible local currencies and cryptocurrencies have evolved into mechanisms used not only in socio-economic experiments, but also by local municipalities and networks of civic society and social and solidarity economy.\n\nThe search results provide comprehensive information about mutual credit systems and community currencies, though the results don't contain specific developments or forecasts specifically dated to 2026."], "durationSeconds": 144.34745662}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01RYmZ9d2dGEjUtPWTx3d3Rk"}}

The gathering is planned for 2026. A bioregional congress offers a place to reconnect, build trust, and coordinate grounded responses rooted in care for our watersheds, ecosystems, and communities.\n\n## Recent Publications on Bioregionalism and Finance\n\nRelationalized finance is structurally designed to prioritize the ecological imperatives of a bioregional landscape, and aims to skillfully conjoin the terms of finance with a bioregion's watersheds, forests, arable land as well as human provisioning systems, communities of practice, and culture.\n\n## Core Concepts of Bioregional Watershed Governance\n\nBioregionalism is a philosophy that suggests that political, cultural, and economic systems are more sustainable and just if they are organized around naturally defined areas called bioregions, which are defined through physical and environmental features, including watershed boundaries and soil and terrain characteristics. Bioregional democracy involves collective decision-making in the management and provisioning of the ecosystems that people depend upon for their existence."], "durationSeconds": 170.05421849500001}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01Rh7nogaarkxwVzvov31AKT"}}

ReFi utilizes DeFi and blockchain to help reverse the effects of industrialisation and systemic financial imbalance.\n\n## Key Technologies and Components\n\nReFi projects use tokenization to create tokens representing real-world assets or ecological outcomes, smart contracts to automate processes like verifying ecological impact, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) to manage funding and allocate resources, and integrate with DeFi protocols to provide financial services like lending and borrowing.\n\n## Current Applications\n\nInnovative examples of Web3 in the ReFi space include tokenized carbon credits, decentralized renewable energy (DRE) platforms, community-owned financial ecosystems, and tokenized incentives for sustainability.\n\n## 2026 Outlook\n\nAs we move toward the future, trends likely to gain momentum include ReFi + AI for monitoring ecological data, ReFi + Real-world Assets (RWAs) for tokenizing everything from clean water access to sustainable housing, ReFi + Gamification using behavioral science for sustainable actions, and Cross-chain ReFi to maximize reach across blockchain networks.\n\n## Critical Perspectives\n\nHowever, there are important caveats. Regenerative practitioners fear that many ReFi initiatives merely apply financial engineering and linear models to environmental challenges and label these protocols as regenerative."], "durationSeconds": 17.42776343400002}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01RfBb8nV9uurpgkQ3ZmqY2F"}}

This move marks a decisive break from the prevailing global consensus that central bank digital currencies should remain non-interest-bearing.\n\n**BRICS Payment System**\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in Rio that a pilot could appear \"before the end of 2026\", though Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov clarified in October 2025 that the system is now targeted for operational status by 2030. The platform will be blockchain-based and decentralised, designed to link existing national systems, and will also integrate central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) from member states, including the digital yuan and digital ruble.\n\n**Brazil's Digital Currency Project (Drex)**\n\nBrazil's Drex project was rolled back and will now launch in 2026, in an initial version without blockchain, focused on infrastructure for reconciling credit liens.\n\n**Community Currencies and Digital Innovation**\n\nLocal community currencies are alternative monetary systems designed to empower local businesses and foster engagement while promoting a greater sense of unity of a place. Mayors from major U.S. cities such as New York City, Jackson, Tampa Bay, Miami, and Austin made headlines by openly endorsing cryptocurrencies and embracing the idea of city-branded tokens.\n\n**Regulatory Developments**\n\nEurope plans to regulate decentralized finance in 2026, as lawmakers still struggle to define decentralization under MiCA, an EU crypto policy expert said."], "durationSeconds": 132.98076192199997}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01DEaAcfQDgNq6zJkarT1hpG"}}

Regen Network -- Recent News 2026\n\n**Biocultural Jaguar Credits Launch:**\nThe Sharamentsa Achuar community, in partnership with Fundacion Pachamama and Regen Network, launched \"Biocultural Jaguar Credits\" to protect 10,000 hectares of jaguar habitat in Ecuador. The initiative uses blockchain technology and advanced monitoring, with pre-financing already underway for this Indigenous-led conservation project.\n\n**Regen Data Stream Tool:**\nRegen Data Stream is now integrated into the Regen App, allowing users to post real-time project updates, anchor data to the blockchain for verification, and manage data privacy settings. It supports environmental projects, scientific research, and sustainability efforts.\n\n**Platform Metrics:**\nThe Regen Network blockchain community consists of 75 validators, 20,000+ wallet holders, and 42 major projects building on Regen Ledger. Partners include Moss.Earth, Open Earth Foundation, Earthbanc, ERA Brazil, Shamba Protocol, and Terra Genesis International.\n\n**Market Performance:**\nREGEN token is down -16.30% over the last 7 days, underperforming the global cryptocurrency market which is down -2.70%.\n\nSources:\n- [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/)\n- [Regen Registry](https://www.registry.regen.network/)\n- [Regen Price on CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/regen)\n- [Regen Network on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/regen-network/)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Ecological Credits -- Carbon & Biodiversity 2026\n\n**Carbon Credit Market Surging:**\nThe carbon credit market is valued at approximately $2.52 billion in 2025, with projections to expand to $3.04 billion in 2026 and reach $16.38 billion by 2035 (CAGR of 20.59%). A separate report from Astute Analytica projects the market growing by 18% to reach $4,938.7 billion by 2035. Growth is driven by corporate demand, net-zero targets, and tightening regulations.\n\n**Biodiversity Co-Benefits Premium:**\nThe market is increasingly rewarding projects that demonstrate tangible positive impacts on biodiversity. Carbon credits carrying biodiversity certifications (such as Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards) command an average price premium of over $2.50 per credit.\n\n**Biodiversity Credit Alliance Strategic Plan:**\nThe Biodiversity Credit Alliance released its 2025-2026 Strategic Plan, charting a path to build a transparent, trustworthy, and high-integrity global biodiversity credit market. The plan focuses on science-based principles, market governance, and ensuring meaningful participation by Indigenous Peoples and local communities. An estimated $598-824 billion funding gap exists to reach Global Biodiversity Framework targets.\n\n**EU Nature Credits:**\nThe EU market for nature credits will align with at least four marine protection policies, helping bridge the funding gap left by carbon markets alone.\n\nSources:\n- [Carbon Credit Business Report 2026 -- GlobeNewsWire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/02/3230006/0/en/Carbon-Credit-Business-Report-2026-Market-to-Grow-by-18-to-Reach-4-938-7-Bn-Investment-Opportunities-by-2035-Astute-Analytica.html)\n- [Carbon Credit Prices and Forecasts 2026 -- Regreener](https://www.regreener.earth/blog/carbon-credit-prices-today-trends-and-forecasts-for-2026)\n- [Biodiversity Credit Alliance](https://www.biodiversitycreditalliance.org/)\n- [Nature & Biodiversity Pulse -- Carbon Pulse](https://carbon-pulse.com/nbp/)\n- [Biodiversity and Carbon Co-Benefits ROI -- Sylvera](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/biodiversity-premiums-co-benefits)\n- [Best EU Carbon Credit Projects of 2026 -- Regreener](https://www.regreener.earth/blog/the-5-best-eu-carbon-credit-projects-of-2026)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Regenerative Agriculture -- February 2026\n\n**USDA $700 Million Regenerative Pilot Program:**\nOn December 10, 2025, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced a $700 million pilot program for regenerative agriculture: $400 million through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and $300 million through the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). The program delivers a streamlined, outcome-based conservation model empowering producers to plan and implement whole-farm regenerative practices through a single application. It is designed for both beginning and advanced producers.\n\n**Food Industry Scaling Regenerative Supply Chains:**\nThree flour brands are redefining how regenerative agriculture scales (as of February 5, 2026). King Arthur Baking Co. has committed to sourcing 100% of its flour from regeneratively grown wheat by 2030. Cairnspring Mills and Simple Mills are also broadening adoption of regenerative sourcing.\n\n**Greenwashing Concerns:**\nPublic health and environmental advocates fear that the loosely defined \"regenerative agriculture\" label in the USDA program will undermine existing organic transition efforts and contribute to greenwashing.

Climate Finance & ReFi 2026\n\n**Global Climate Finance Exceeds $2 Trillion:**\nGlobal climate finance hit an all-time high of $1.9 trillion in 2023, with early data indicating it exceeded $2 trillion for the first time in 2024. At COP30, countries solidified the Baku to Belem (B2B) Roadmap aiming for $1.3 trillion/year in international finance to developing countries by 2035.\n\n**UK Climate Finance U-Turn Risk:**\nAs of February 7, 2026, there are concerns that the UK may be about to reverse its climate financing commitments to poorer countries, despite the global pledge to triple climate financing.\n\n**UNEP State of Finance for Nature 2026:**\nUNEP has published its State of Finance for Nature 2026 report, providing a comprehensive overview of nature-related financial flows.\n\n**2026 Sustainable Finance Opportunities (WRI):**\nThe World Resources Institute identified six opportunities for sustainable finance in 2026, noting that core banking, investor, and insurance commitments on climate and nature finance remain relatively robust despite well-publicized attacks and the shuttering of net-zero alliances for banking and insurance.\n\n**ReFi Movement Analysis:**\nA Frontiers in Blockchain paper examined \"The ReFi movement in Web3: implications for the Global Commons,\" while a companion paper offered a critical evaluation of the regenerative claims of Web3's ReFi movement. Key trends for 2026 include ReFi + AI for ecological data monitoring, ReFi + Real-World Assets (RWAs), ReFi + gamification for sustainable behaviors, and cross-chain ReFi. However, critics note that many ReFi initiatives may merely apply financial engineering and linear models to environmental challenges under a regenerative label.\n\nSources:\n- [6 Opportunities for Sustainable Finance in 2026 -- WRI](https://www.wri.org/technical-perspectives/6-opportunities-sustainable-finance-2026)\n- [UK Climate Finance Concerns -- Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/green/2026/02/07/the-world-has-pledged-to-triple-climate-financing-for-poorer-countries-is-the-uk-about-to-)\n- [State of Finance for Nature 2026 -- UNEP](https://www.unep.org/resources/state-finance-nature-2026)\n- [Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2025 -- CPI](https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2025/)\n- [12 Investors on Climate Tech in 2026 -- TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/12-investors-dish-on-what-2026-will-bring-for-climate-tech/)\n- [The ReFi Movement in Web3 -- Frontiers in Blockchain](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/blockchain/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2025.1564073/full)\n- [Critical Evaluation of ReFi Claims -- Frontiers in Blockchain](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/blockchain/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2025.1564083/full)\n- [Climate and Nature Finance Conference, Spring 2026 -- NBER](https://www.nber.org/conferences/climate-and-nature-finance-spring-2026)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cosmos Ecosystem & IBC -- February 2026\n\n**IBC Eureka (IBC v2) Live:**\nIBC Eureka is the main implementation of IBC v2, offering seamless bridging and interoperability to hundreds of chains through one IBC connection to the Cosmos Hub. The ecosystem now provides access to 120+ chains from Cosmos to Ethereum and beyond, with faster-than-finality transfers, low fees, and native asset issuance.\n\n**2026 Roadmap -- Multi-Chain Expansion:**\nEthereum was added to the IBC network in 2025. In 2026, work is expected to add dozens more networks. Cosmos Labs is close to productionizing IBC v2 light clients for Solana and a general solution for EVM/L2 chains. The Q2 roadmap targets IBC GMP, IFT, Solana and L2/EVM support. Q4 targets SDK releases aiming for 5,000 TPS and 500ms blocktimes sustained in production.\n\n**Sei Network Departing Cosmos:**\nSei Network has scheduled the disabling of inbound IBC transfers for February 2026 as part of its transition to becoming an EVM-only chain by mid-2026, fully abandoning the Cosmos SDK.\n\nSources:\n- [The Cosmos Stack Roadmap for 2026 -- Cosmos Labs](https://www.cosmoslabs.io/blog/the-cosmos-stack-roadmap-2026)\n- [IBC Eureka Connects Ethereum to Cosmos -- The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/350316/interchain-labs-launches-ibc-eureka-to-connect-ethereum-to-the-cosmos-ecosystem)\n- [Sei Network Abandons Cosmos for EVM](https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/finance/sei-network-sets-mid-2026-target-for-fully-abandon-cosmos-for-evm-only-chain/)\n- [IBC Ecosystem -- Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/ibc)\n- [Cosmos IBC Eureka Announcement on X](https://x.com/cosmos/status/1910289530067747019)\n\n---\n\n## 6. MRV & Ecological Monitoring 2026\n\n**CO2 Monitoring Verification System Going Operational:**\nThe CO2 Monitoring, Verification and Support system (CO2MVS) is expected to become operational in 2026, aligned with the launch of a new Copernicus Sentinel satellite mission. This prototype system will estimate CO2 and CH4 emissions from human activities on global, regional, and local scales.\n\n**Soil Organic Carbon Monitoring (MRV4SOC):**\nThe MRV4SOC project focuses on creating a monitoring system for soil organic carbon, tracking long-term SOC accumulation changes in nine ecosystem types representing distinct land use types within the EU.\n\n**Modular MRV Frameworks for Carbon:**\nResearchers published a framework for a modular, scalable MRV system covering croplands, grasslands, and forestlands, moving toward standardized monitoring across multiple ecosystem types.\n\n**ICOS Science Conference 2026:**\nThe ICOS Science Conference 2026 will take place September 15-17 in Lund, Sweden, with a call for abstracts on \"Advancing MRV through Research Infrastructures.\"\n\nSources:\n- [Modular MRV Framework for Soil Carbon -- Taylor & Francis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17583004.2024.2410812)\n- [MRV 101: State of MRV in Nature Tech -- Nature Tech Collective](https://www.naturetechcollective.org/stories/mrv-101-the-state-of-measurement-reporting-and-verification-in-nature-tech)\n- [Advancing MRV at ICOS Science Conference 2026 -- eLTER RI](https://elter-ri.eu/news/call-abstracts-advancing-mrv-through-research-infrastructures-icos-science-conference-2026)\n- [EU MRV for Emissions Trading -- European Commission](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/carbon-markets/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets/monitoring-reporting-and-verification_en)\n\n---\n\n## 7. Community Currencies & Mutual Credit 2026\n\n**China's Digital Yuan Pays Interest (January 1, 2026):**\nChina's digital yuan entered a new era on January 1, 2026, as wallet balances began accruing interest at demand deposit rates. This breaks the prevailing global consensus that central bank digital currencies should remain non-interest-bearing, and could reshape how digital currencies are designed worldwide.\n\n**BRICS Payment System Pilot:**\nRussian Foreign Minister Lavrov said a BRICS payment system pilot could appear \"before the end of 2026.\" The platform will be blockchain-based and decentralized, linking existing national systems and integrating CBDCs from member states including the digital yuan and digital ruble. Target operational status is 2030.\n\n**Brazil's Drex Rollback:**\nBrazil's Drex digital currency project was rolled back and will now launch in 2026 in an initial version without blockchain, focused on infrastructure for reconciling credit liens.\n\n**EU Regulating Decentralized Finance:**\nEurope plans to regulate decentralized finance in 2026 as lawmakers struggle to define decentralization under MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation).\n\n**Community Currency Conceptual Developments:**\nResearch continues on the circulation dynamics of digital community currencies, with a 2023 Nature paper analyzing transaction patterns. The broader movement continues connecting local exchange trading systems, time banks, community exchange networks, and B2B barter exchanges, though no major new community currency launches were found for early 2026.\n\nSources:\n- [China Digital Yuan Interest-Bearing Features -- CGTN](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2026-01-05/VHJhbnNjcmlwdDg4MzQ4/index.html)\n- [China Breaks CBDC Orthodoxy -- Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-breaks-cbdc-orthodoxy-digital-050942170.html)\n- [Digital Currencies Tracker -- Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/digital-currencies/)\n- [Community Currency to Crypto City Tokens -- Belfer Center](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/community-currency-crypto-city-tokens-potentials-shortfalls-and-future-outlooks-new-old)\n- [Circulation of a Digital Community Currency -- Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-33184-1)\n\n---\n\n## 8. Bioregionalism & Watershed Governance 2026\n\n**Continental Bioregional Congress Planned for 2026:**\nFor the first time in more than 15 years, bioregionalists from across North America are coming together to plan a Continental Bioregional Congress. The Cascadia Department of Bioregion is calling for site location suggestions (deadline April 8). The gathering will bring organizers, artists, land stewards, and community leaders from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to reconnect, build trust, and coordinate grounded responses rooted in care for watersheds, ecosystems, and communities.\n\n**Bioregionalism, Commoning, and Relationalized Finance (January 8, 2026):**\nA new essay on Resilience.org explores \"relationalized finance\" -- finance structurally designed to prioritize the ecological imperatives of a bioregional landscape, conjoining the terms of finance with a bioregion's watersheds, forests, arable land, human provisioning systems, communities of practice, and culture.\n\n**Bioregional Governance Training Guide for Asia-Pacific:**\nECOLISE published a Bioregional Governance Training Guide for climate-resilient ecosystems in Asia and the Pacific, providing frameworks for applying bioregional governance principles in diverse contexts.\n\n**NOEMA Feature on Bioregionalism's Tech-Driven Revival:**\nNOEMA magazine published \"Inside Bioregionalism's Tech-Driven Revival,\" examining how technology is being used to rebuild society around ecosystems rather than political boundaries.\n\n**Bioregional Earth Movement:**\nThe Bioregional Earth organization continues documenting the emergence of the bioregional movement, mapping how Mother Earth is being remapped as bioregions rather than nation-states.\n\nSources:\n- [Continental Bioregional Congress 2026 -- Cascadia Department of Bioregion](https://cascadiabioregion.org/department-of-bioregion/a-continental-bioregional-congress-is-in-the-works-for-2026-suggest-a-site-location-by-april-8th)\n- [Bioregionalism, Commoning, and Relationalized Finance -- Resilience.org](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2026-01-08/bioregionalism-commoning-and-relationalized-finance/)\n- [Human Watershed: Bioregional Democracy -- Kosmos Journal](https://www.kosmosjournal.org/article/human-watershed-the-emerging-politics-of-bioregional-democracy/)\n- [Inside Bioregionalism's Tech-Driven Revival -- NOEMA](https://www.noemamag.com/inside-the-push-to-rebuild-society-around-ecosystems/)\n- [Bioregional Governance Training Guide -- ECOLISE](https://ecolise.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Bioregional-Governance-Training-Guide.pdf)\n- [The Bioregional Movement -- Bioregional Earth](https://www.bioregionalearth.org/blog/bioregional-movement)\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Cutting Themes for the Digest\n\nSeveral threads connect across these topics that would be worth highlighting in a daily digest:\n\n1. **Indigenous-led conservation meets blockchain**: The Biocultural Jaguar Credits on Regen Network and the Biodiversity Credit Alliance's focus on Indigenous participation reflect a growing convergence of Indigenous stewardship and digital infrastructure.\n\n2. **Institutional money flowing into regenerative systems**: The USDA's $700M regenerative pilot, the carbon credit market projected to reach $3B+ in 2026, and climate finance exceeding $2 trillion all signal that regenerative approaches are entering mainstream financial flows -- with accompanying greenwashing tensions.\n\n3. **IBC expansion creates opportunities for ecological assets**: With IBC v2 connecting 120+ chains and adding Solana/EVM support in 2026, the infrastructure for cross-chain ecological credit trading is maturing, even as some chains (Sei) depart the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\n4. **MRV infrastructure maturing alongside credit markets**: The CO2MVS satellite system going operational in 2026 and modular soil carbon MRV frameworks align with Regen Network's core thesis that credible ecological credits require robust monitoring infrastructure.\n\n5. **Bioregionalism gaining institutional momentum**: The first Continental Bioregional Congress in 15+ years and new frameworks for \"relationalized finance\" suggest the bioregional governance model is moving from theory toward practice.\n\n6. **Digital currency experiments diversifying**: China's interest-bearing digital yuan, the BRICS payment pilot, and EU DeFi regulation show that the monetary landscape is fragmenting in ways that create both opportunities and regulatory challenges for community-scale economic experiments."}], "totalDurationMs": 451262, "totalTokens": 34981, "totalToolUseCount": 10, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 5699, "cache_read_input_tokens": 24044, "output_tokens": 5237, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 5699, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}}}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_011rpdx3CM3oHw1zknAdzY4F"}}
